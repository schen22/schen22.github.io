### File Structure:
```
├── index.html (GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY)
├── build.js (builds index.html from components)
├── components/
│   ├── partials/
│   │   ├── head.html (viewport, meta tags, stylesheets)
│   │   ├── navigation.html (nav dots, progress bar)
│   │   └── scripts.html (JavaScript imports)
│   └── sections/
│       ├── hero.html (main hero section)
│       ├── about.html (about section)
│       ├── projects.html (projects section)
│       └── contact.html (contact section)
