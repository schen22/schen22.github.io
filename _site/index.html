          <p>I wanted to share nuggets of wisdom from various people I’ve been meeting up within the industry. The primary questions I’ve been asking are what drives their confidence, what their journey entails, and what the most pivotal moment of their career has been so far. It was fascinating to learn and observe how everyone has their own style, work ethic and drive; and yet they all attained a relative degree of success and satisfaction that they wanted.</p>

<p><strong>Nugget #1: Optimize for happiness.</strong></p>

<p>For me, this translates to building something useful for others: share warm and fuzzies, allow others to feel that they belong, and give people a platform to be heard by recognizing every person has a voice they can use. Facebook has the power to accomplish this, but more on this later.</p>

<p><strong>Nugget #2: Believe in yourself.</strong> Continue doing what needs to be done, and the rest will follow.</p>

<p>My mentor resolves conflicts by being so good others are unable to ignore them. Of course, it helps that my mentor loves to build and solve problems. Truly an inspiration for me to keep learning from. :)</p>

<p><strong>Nugget #2.5: Trust yourself.</strong> You’ll become better at estimating and setting deadlines. Tell your manager what the unknown factors are and add a little more time into how long you think it might actually take.</p>

<p><strong>Nugget #3: Break things to learn!</strong> Break apart small pieces to figure out what makes a solution work. For any challenge you’re facing, someone has probably already built a solution or something that’s similar.</p>

<p><strong>Nugget #4: Keep on moving forward.</strong> As long as you don’t hate what you’re doing and don’t hate your team - keep at it. There’s always a better way to do something, and you should always recognize that. But don’t beat yourself up for not implementing the perfect solution right off the bat. Recognize that there’s always a better way to build what you’re building, but also recognize that you’ve gotten better, you’ve improved, and that you’ve learned.</p>

<p>My mentor encouraged me to look back at old code I’ve written, then realize that I probably wouldn’t have written it that way if I were to do it again. And that’s progress.</p>

<p>After meeting up with multiple people, I also realized it’s not just advice I was looking for. I was looking for some way to find myself and find my own drive, intuition, and confidence. But at some point I just have to tune out the self-doubt I have in order to focus on what’s next. Just keep moving forward and the path will follow.</p>

          <p>It’s been awhile again but I’ve been feeling a bit burnt out from work. Thus the need to force myself to reflect more often! So guiding questions if not for today, for every day:</p>

<p>What are three things that made me happy today? (I declare these warm and fuzzies).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spending a late Sunday night playing board games spontaneously with friends while making Yu-Gi-Oh jokes to ‘trust in the heart of the cards’ and d-d-d-d-d-d-d-duel! Spontaneity I feel is harder to come by as years pass, so I lean more into the moment and appreciate how and when it happens.</li>
  <li>Chatting with my grandma, exchanging gossip and being able to remind her that I’ll see her soon.</li>
  <li>Seeing the California skyline - backdrop of mountains with a splatter of blue accented white background. California is beautiful and the scenic landscape definitely brought a smile to my face as I was driving down 237 today.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t have much on my mind lately which worries me. The one thing I don’t want to become is a mindless worker bee that fulfills the expectations and plans passed down from above. Time passes without me realizing, and within a blink of an eye it’s already been almost a year since I’ve moved to the bay area. That frightens me, so how can I take back the reigns and take control of what happens daily? What’s my next step?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/hobbes_weird.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Step 1. Lean into what I know – time to start tinkering and put the anime away!</p>

<p>Step 2. Idea pot - quick, jot down all the things that come to mind within a minute:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Convert all the photos that get shared on Messenger in my family group chat into an album for my family to search through. Add in some photo recognition technology to allow people to easily search by date, place, name/nickname.</li>
  <li>Happiness jar that lets me jot down notes or special moments that make me happy every day for me to look back on. The goal is to help motivate through rough patches and remind myself just how beautiful life is.</li>
  <li>Create one frame of an animation you love. (Though tbh this has been on my mind for awhile, but it seems so difficult I haven’t really looked much into it.)</li>
  <li>Running journal - the one I mentioned a while back but never finished LOL.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 3. I’m making this up here - so I’m assuming this step should be a plan of action to commit to. Do what I love and ignore all of the wanted accolades, awards, recognition, whatever that puts unnecessary stress on myself. I can only control what I do, and how I feel about myself.</p>

<p>I’m not too sure what should or will come of this, but I hope I’ll create a project some time soon on Github. I like the idea of a happiness jar honestly. Should be a fairly straightforward thing to make - I’ll put up some prototypes and get to work.</p>

<p>Lastly, I challenge myself this week to ask to grab lunch with one of my role models at work. One of my coworkers I highly admire recently left. Regrettably I wasn’t able to say my farewells and thank you’s in person because I chickened out. I honestly can’t remember the last time I’ve been so timid at work to the point where I regret not doing something so badly. I don’t want that to happen again - thus this challenge. Like spontaneity, I need to lean in to my fear. And with that, the quote of the day is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure, the process is its own reward.” - Amelia Earhart</p>
</blockquote>

          <p>There’s more to life than solely success.</p>

<p>The pursuit of happiness; the desire to see who others are for who they are. To recognize that everyone is fighting their own battles. We are who we are, and although it’s simple enough to say, to truly always be accepting of others and of myself is so much more challenging.</p>

<p>This past weekend I had the amazing opportunity to travel to New York. Call it a whim - but it’s helped me open my eyes even more.</p>

<p>It’s so easy to get caught up in everyday life. I know I’ve reflected on this before already. But I still haven’t learned a good handle on how to remind myself to enjoy where I am. I have a tendency to rush through the things I do because I’m impatient to get to the next step, to get to the next level, to get to the next stage of my life.</p>

<p>People always tell me - enjoy where you are now because you only live your life once. #yolo.</p>

<p>But I always disliked that piece of advice. It made me feel as if they know something about where they are now, that I don’t. That they’ve already overcome challenges that I have yet to even know about - and who likes feeling left out?</p>

<p>But it’s so easy to forget how beautiful and wonderful life is. How every single moment, every challenge is precious and unable to be repeated. I could argue that there’s a diminishing margins of returns to everything that I do, and another side could argue the inevitable “it depends.”</p>

<p>I brought up New York because I discovered there’s so much more of the world that I have yet to see. Even though it wasn’t my first time there (I hated my first visit there for the record), I was fascinated by how I was able to walk down the street and neither understand nor recognize any of the languages being spoken. Given, I was walking down a pretty touristy area right next to Wall Street; but I was amazed by the diversity of the people. I kept waiting, smiling at my stupid excitement, waiting for some couple or some family or some group of people or some one to walk by and speak english - but no one did. And how I loved it.</p>

<p>There’s so much more to life than I can even dream about. Tell that to five year old me and you’d catch me staring back at you with the answer, “but I like the candy I dream about.” The beyond and the unknown used to scare me; but it’s exciting and motivating. I want to see the world’s wonders and challenge the scope of how I view the world. I want to continue to have these paradigm shifts. I want to hear people’s stories. I don’t think traveling is the answer, but it’s one of the means. I think more importantly is the desire for me to see and to listen. To push myself out of my comfort zone and to socialize more with people.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a conversation I had with a friend of mine recently. He asked me, “How do you work so hard and stay motivated?” I looked at him, amazed that he even thought I worked hard. And further, “What’s your end goal?”</p>

<p>I don’t know. But I think we make people who we think they are in our minds. That’s not to say that his opinion of me isn’t true or justified. My point isn’t about the validity of the statement or to even answer the question, but to remark how the way I see myself isn’t the way how others see me and vice versa. It’s fascinating to me how the human mind works. Questions, the desire to know how others think and do; the desire to understand and learn more. It helps make connections and establish a common ground to walk together though.</p>

<p>The fact that we all come from different walks of life and yet are so troubled by our own problems we forget that sometimes the answer lies in simply talking to others.</p>

<p>“Be the change you wish to see in the world.” - Mahatma Gandhi. My sister used to wear this shirt all the time; maybe to help advertise people to join the high school JSA club advertised on the front of the shirt. (kidding). I think we all aspire to be more - to make a difference and assert our place in the world.  I think we all have the desire to be someone - someone to be remembered, someone who’s invaluable, someone who feels as if they belong and are needed.</p>

<p>(Rambling again. But some in literature could call it a stream of consciousness. I don’t recommend that book by James Joyce by the way. The stream of consciousness was terrible to follow).</p>

<p>I’m just beginning my own journey and I’m so truly excited for what’s to come because where I’m at now. By golly gosh darn. Life’s simply amazing because I allow it to be.</p>

        <time class="post_date">05 February 2018, Monday</time>

      <div class="post_excerpt">
        <p>
          
          <p>I’ve decided I want to define success more concretely, and I happened upon a great read this past weekend that inspired this redefinition. Rather than to be defined or (what I feel at times) restricted to the job I have, the role I play on my team, or the lines of code I write a day, I want to define success on the basis of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number minutes I spend running every day in order to stay healthy and do all the things I want to do in life.</li>
  <li>the number of times I laugh or enjoy the conversations I have by staying present and open-minded to situations around me.</li>
  <li>the number of minutes I spend on the phone with my parents because I care about my family.</li>
  <li>the number of times I speak up among a group of people in order to remember I have a voice.</li>
  <li>the number of lessons learned to satisfy my love of learning and desire to understand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Health, presence, family, attitude and aptitude. Suffice it to say I think these can act as goals to ground me throughout the day to concentrate more on what I want to do, and less on what I do.</p>

<p>While there’s no measure that I can compare myself to just yet, I can create some type of iPython notebook to track (at the very least) physical exercise. I’ve been wanting to get a little more in data analysis. And plus I’m signed up for the half marathon so honestly I should be running more than the 2-3 miles I get. THREE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE! Oh wait, four! Because this way I can guarantee comparisons of myself to me (rather than others).</p>

<p>Now though, I’m wondering how do these definitions of success relate to the goals that I have at work?</p>

<p>I guess to put a different spin on it: in order to learn more, I have to review more code, and ask questions to code more effectively. In a way, the more I do, the more I learn. So by the communicative property, if learning comes first, inherently, the goals or expectations set at work will follow. I think the most important lesson I’ve learned is, “Me first.” Because honestly there’s no one else that will ever do so, nor would I want them to. I have to own my own way and what I do. To do this I have to be comfortable with putting myself first.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean I should become a jackass or some arrogant coworker who only thinks of what I want and ignores all else. I still have my values to keep me in check for that thankfully. Rather, it’s more I want to focus on what I want to accomplish, how to get to where I want to go; rather than to concentrate on how others are doing or give in to the norm. For example the other day at Costco there was this couple that cut in front of me. And rather than speaking up, I just stood there silently and took it. While this may be an extreme example, it’s been aggravating me that I hadn’t spoke up.</p>

<p>But at the same time that’s okay because I can take it as a learning experience. I just need to practice what I should say in these settings because I’m not used to that happening to me. (I mean come on, I’m a cute Asian girl; who can ignore me :P). In any case, next time I’m prepared to say, “Excuse me sir/miss, I was already here in line,” and then give them a chance to explain themselves. If they’re in some sort of emergency then by all means take my spot; but I shouldn’t let people take advantage of me.</p>

<p>Random other goals I’ll update at another time but want to jot down for now:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I want to increase my circle of influence.</li>
  <li>I want to go backpacking or camping in the mountains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cheerios,</p>

          <p>Sunday learning for today has taken me longer than usual. At the same time I think it’s quite necessary to understand these various patterns that come across often: subclass, protocol, delegation, configuration objects, composition.</p>

<p>Subclassing by itself seems to make sense; but I get mixed up when I look at protocol and delegation together. But first let’s stick with what I’ve found out about subclassing and I’ll save comparing the two patterns for next time.</p>

<p>Class clusters hide implementation details behind abstract classes. However, because objective-c has nothing to label classes as ‘abstract,’ convention is therefore found in the docs. (Which honestly I find pretty arbitrary and confusing..) Class clusters is a type of factory pattern that defines all the necessary logic those that inherit the base class must implement. In other words: subclasses can override default implementation of base classes. Here’s an example of a subclass with my favorite example using Pokemon:</p>

<p><em>Abstract base class</em></p>

  <span class="n">PokemonTypeFire</span><span class="p">,</span>

<p>In the subclass example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">attack</code> method is required to implement Pokemon. When checking for equality between subclasses, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">isKindOfClass:[Pokemon class]</code> method rather than comparing with <code class="highlighter-rouge">[Pokemon class]</code> itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Subclasses should inherit from the class cluster’s abstract base class.</li>
  <li>Subclass should define its own storage.</li>
  <li>Subclass should override required methods of superclass.</li>
</ul>

<p>Out of all these rules for subclassing, the second one is the most confusing to me. So let’s walk through another Pokemon example.</p>

<p>Overall it looks like subclasses are more commonly used for implementing custom parts of a platform, and model objects. i.e. in view controllers when we subclass UIViewController; or building a UITableViewCell with custom layout. Any time something can be more reusable across other parts of the project seem to be a good opportunity to subclass.</p>

<p>Until next time. Back to work!</p>
