        <p>
          
          <p>Sunday learning for today has taken me longer than usual. At the same time I think it’s quite necessary to understand these various patterns that come across often: subclass, protocol, delegation, configuration objects, composition.</p>

<p>Subclassing by itself seems to make sense; but I get mixed up when I look at protocol and delegation together. But first let’s stick with what I’ve found out about subclassing and I’ll save comparing the two patterns for next time.</p>

<p>Class clusters hide implementation details behind abstract classes. However, because objective-c has nothing to label classes as ‘abstract,’ convention is therefore found in the docs. (Which honestly I find pretty arbitrary and confusing..) Class clusters is a type of factory pattern that defines all the necessary logic those that inherit the base class must implement. In other words: subclasses can override default implementation of base classes. Here’s an example of a subclass with my favorite example using Pokemon:</p>

<p><em>Abstract base class</em></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="nf">NS_ENUM</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NSUInteger</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">PokemonType</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">PokemonTypeWater</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">PokemonTypeFire</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">PokemonTypeGrass</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">@interface</span> <span class="nc">Pokemon</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nc">NSObject</span>
<span class="k">@property</span> <span class="n">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">@property</span> <span class="n">NSUInteger</span> <span class="n">level</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Pokemon</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">pokemonWithType</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">PokemonType</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">type</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">attack</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">@end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Subclass</em></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">@interface</span> <span class="nc">PokemonWater</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nc">Pokemon</span>
<span class="k">@end</span>
<span class="k">@implementation</span> <span class="nc">PokemonWater</span>
<span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">attack</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">self</span> <span class="nf">waterGun</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">@end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the subclass example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">attack</code> method is required to implement Pokemon. When checking for equality between subclasses, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">isKindOfClass:[Pokemon class]</code> method rather than comparing with <code class="highlighter-rouge">[Pokemon class]</code> itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Subclasses should inherit from the class cluster’s abstract base class.</li>
  <li>Subclass should define its own storage.</li>
  <li>Subclass should override required methods of superclass.</li>
</ul>

<p>Out of all these rules for subclassing, the second one is the most confusing to me. So let’s walk through another Pokemon example.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">@interface</span> <span class="nc">PokemonWater</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nc">Pokemon</span>

<p>Overall it looks like subclasses are more commonly used for implementing custom parts of a platform, and model objects. i.e. in view controllers when we subclass UIViewController; or building a UITableViewCell with custom layout. Any time something can be more reusable across other parts of the project seem to be a good opportunity to subclass.</p>

          <p>I need to learn about ‘Message Forwarding and Method Swizzling’ today, but I just have to share a few quotes I’m reading from what is becoming my favorite book so far.</p>

<p><em>All the Light We Cannot See</em> has captivated my imagination and attention. Anthony Doerr has a way with words that captures all senses succinctly to paint an imagery as if I’m there with the characters he’s describing, living out the plot in real time as I read.</p>

<p>In the book, a young girl who became blind experiences the world the way she knows how: through sound logic, reason, and the ability to accept her fears and see the world her own way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The faintly metallic smell of the falling snow surrounds her. <em>Calm yourself. Listen.</em>” - Anthony Doerr</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too often I’m lost in the depths of my thoughts when all I need to do is take a deep breath, and take the next step forward. Here, Marie-Laure is learning how to walk with her cane. Every week her father challenges her to lead them home, and every week she gets a little better despite her frustrations and disbelief she can. Little by little, week after week she makes progress until she eventually and finds her way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In another half second her father’s hands are in her armpits, swinging her up, and Marie-Laure smiles, and he laughs a pure, contagious laugh, one she will try to remember all her life, father and daughter turning in circles on the sidewalk in front of their apartment house, laughing together while snow sifts through the branches above.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve fallen in love with Marie-Laure. A little girl who has all the patience in the world it seems, with a loving father who is determined to stay by her side and give her the tools to live her life the way she can. Moments like these make me fill me with warm and fuzzies. The best moments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Open your eyes…and see what you can with them before they close forever.”</em> - Anthony Doerr</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s to continuing to explore and learn; to keep plodding along. Despite the increasingly long hours I spend at work it’s honestly so exciting to see how we breathe life into a product. I feel extremely grateful to be a part of the grueling process to make something that’s so carefully researched and thought out. As for our deadline, we’ll see whether we can make it. When our deadline is set won’t determine what I’ll accomplish. I can only control what I do every day - step after step, task after task, and how I challenge myself to move faster, improve, and learn more.</p>

        <p>
          
          <p>Some things that seem obvious to others, to me need to be studied more thoroughly. One such topic I want to focus on this week is properties.
But why Objective-C? Mainly because that’s the language we use at Facebook to build our app. And also because I want to better understand why we choose to use Objective-C rather than the ‘sexier’ Swift language.</p>

<p>Properties are thought of as accessors to a variable in a data object.</p>

<p>@synthesize: controls name of instance variable.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">@implementation</span> <span class="nc">Pokemon</span>
<span class="k">@synthesize</span> <span class="n">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">_myType</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">@synthesize</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">_myName</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">@end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Usually we would just let the compiler automatically write the code for these methods (ie. autosynthesis). For example, the two instance variables above would instead be <code class="highlighter-rouge">_type</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">_name</code> with autosynthesis.</p>

<p>To prevent the compiler from synthesizing an accessor method we can use @dynamic. This tells the compiler to not create an instance variable and accessor. Instead the compiler trusts us that the variable will be available at runtime:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">@implementation</span> <span class="nc">Pokemon</span>
<span class="k">@dynamic</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">@end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Property Attributes</em></p>

<p>For example: <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="k">@property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nonatomic</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">readwrite</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">copy</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">type</span><span class="p">;</span></code></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Atomicity</strong>: By default accessors are locked to ensure atomicity.</li>
  <li><strong>Read/Write</strong>: (readonly, readwrite) where only a getter is available for the former and a getter/setter available for the latter.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory-Management</strong>: affects only the setter
    <ul>
      <li>assign: used for scalar types like CGFloat or NSInteger</li>
      <li>strong: the property defines an owning relationship. I wonder if I can make this analogy. Let’s say we have six Pokemon on hand and we catch a seventh one: Gulpin. Because we are required to hold six Pokemon at all time, we first “retain” Gulpin, “release” Caterpie and set Guplin as our new sixth Pokemon. Similar to a <strong>strong</strong> semantic when a new value is set we first retain it, release the old value, and then set the new value.</li>
      <li>weak: property defines a nonowning relationship. When a new value is set, the new value is not retained and the old value is not released. The main difference between weak and assign is that a weak property’s value will have nilled out if the object it’s defined as is ever destroyed. (Hm I guess the Pokemon analogy doesn’t work at all. Will need to think more otherwise I’ll just be confusing myself. Shall update later).</li>
      <li>unsafe_unretained: same as assign but indicates a nonowning relationship (unretained) that’s not nilled out (unsafe) when the target is destroyed</li>
      <li>copy: owning relationship like strong but rather than retaining value, it copies the value. Usually used for NSString* or mutable objects to preserve encapsulation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Method Names</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>getter=<name>: usually used for Bool properties to define getter name.
</name>        <ul>
          <li><code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="k">@property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nonatomic</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">getter</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">didLearn</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">BOOL</span> <span class="n">learn</span><span class="p">;</span></code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>setter=<name>: specifies setter name. Not usually used.</name></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Definitions I need to remember</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To be <strong>Statically allocated</strong> means that memory is allocated at compile time.</li>
  <li>A <strong>runtime</strong> is like the baker at a bakery that grabs all the ingredients (data structure, functions, memory-management methods, etc.) to mix together and bake a cake (aka the library that code is linked to to run).</li>
</ul>

<p>Objective-C discovers object type at runtime and can be described as a messaging structure with dynamic binding.</p>

<p>Let’s break that sentence down: Messaging structure uses dynamic binding, meaning the runtime decides which code gets executed. (Whereas languages like python has function calling which decides which code will be executed. I think?).</p>

<p>Need to finish this up later. Time to grocery shop!</p>

        <p>
          
          <p>Ever since I moved back to California, I’ve been itching to find something fulfilling to do in my free time. I want the knowledge I have and am learning to be useful for others and myself. I want to figure out how to best help others with what I know.</p>

<p>It’s always this question of how to best use what I know to help others that sits in my mind. How do I determine the correct balance between giving back, and taking the time for myself to develop more substantial knowledge and skills? I aim to always be a life-long learner and teacher, but I often find myself asking - what’s the most optimal route to take?</p>

<p>I need to set aside time to reflect more often and compile what I have learned together with the prospect of answering these questions; it is too easy to fall into the habit of taking what I have for granted. I need to remember how grateful I am for being able to afford to live in the Bay area, how grateful I am to be working for one of the top companies in my field, with one of the best teams, and on one of the most exciting projects. I am grateful for being able to learn more and improve myself, every day. I am grateful.</p>

<p>And yet I constantly find myself complaining about the traffic, the lack of affordable housing, the tech bubble that seems suffocating at times. But every moment I have no matter where I am is an opportunity to learn from others, and to become more inspired by others and their dreams. Being in the center of the tech industry, information overload occurs all the time with the vast amount of people and talent. But I should recognize that as an opportunity to take advantage of rather than complain and hide behind my insecurities of not knowing enough. I need to remember to keep moving forward and to continue to learn more from those around me.</p>

<p>It’s easy to become lost in the flow of time; to be controlled by deadlines, team meetings, bugs filed, and pinging notifications. But the need to sit back and think about all I’ve done and learned is a higher priority.</p>

<p>Here’s to taking control of time.</p>

<p>What’s next? A journal to keep track of lessons learned; what I’m reading, and how to apply it to improving my daily life. What I’ve learned from the book I’m currently reading is to set deadlines for myself to keep myself honest. Dan Ariely describes in <em>Predictably Irrational</em> how I should expect my future self to procrastinate. Thus to combat my future self my present self needs to provide a strict deadline to keep up with.</p>

<p>Here’s to beginning to update my website once a week every Sunday morning. Hats off to another chapter.</p>

<p>Cheerios,
Sarah</p>
