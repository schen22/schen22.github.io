          <p>Today was wonderful.</p>

<center><img src="assets/img/kay_performance.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500" /></center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>As soon as Sarah Kay and Phil Kaye started performing, I started crying. I don’t know if growing older means I become more easily overtaken by emotions, or if I appreciate the beauty of language and words more - but I sure appreciate the ability to bask in the talents of others. Ohmygoodness witnessing others’ talents is truly awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>The words performed seemed to express the essence of life, of understanding, friendship, love, heartbreak, pain, conflict; the ups and downs of everyday moments. I want to say Sarah and Phil’s poems were simple but they are so much more. I rushed to buy Sarah’s books.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<center><img src="assets/img/kay_books.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500" /></center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The poem that’s stuck with me the most taught me that a murmuration is a flock of starlings. I can still remember: Sarah Kay lifts her arms to mimic a bird flying. As she speaks, a flock of birds forms the image of a bird across salted waves and a sanded beach. She hasn’t even started her poem yet. She explains how the poem she’s about to perform came into being, “I came across this quote one day, ‘the universe has already written the poem you were going to write,’ and I agonized over it as a poet.”</p>

<p>She then explained how there’s nothing truly new that exists in the world, but that doesn’t mean every poem she writes will necessarily recreate another’s work. It also doesn’t mean she needs to spend more time to create original, fresh work. Instead, poetry is about finding new perspectives to view the same, ‘old’ thing.</p>

<p>As an engineer, as an artist - there are the same trends that fall, rise, fall, only to rise again in a seemingly unpredictable fashion. The constant in the change is knowing that the same trend will come back again.</p>

<p>I think what stuck even more in my head is hearing that someone I’ve been admiring for 7 years now, can struggle and can overcome even after a decade or longer of performing as a professional artist - I don’t know why but it really comforted me. The realization of not needing to pressure myself to create distinct products was also nice.</p>

<center><img src="assets/img/kay_signature.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500" /></center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>If you haven’t listened to Sarah Kay, I can’t recommend her art enough. The following poem comforted me my first semester at Berkeley when I felt homesick, soaked from the autumn downpour, and chilled to the core. Her poem provided me strength to keep moving forward. I guess that’s why I stood in line to grab her signature, too overcome to exchange anything other than my name. I think I even forgot to say thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sarah. Thank you, Phil.</p>

          <p>Ursula K Le Guin quotes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I believe that maturity is not an outgrowing, but a growing up: that an adult is not a dead child, but a child who survived.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The opposite of spare time is, I guess, occupied time. In my case I still don’t know what spare time is because all my time is occupied. It always has been and it is now. It’s occupied by living.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I keep reading voraciously to find the answer. What’s my question though? I have this unsettling unease where I keep wanting to settle down. An unreachable itch that won’t rest until I figure out what it is that I do best. Where am I going? What marks the end? What is my destination?</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s just about going out there and doing it. Whatever ‘it’ refers to.</p>

<p>How does data flow between server and client?
I think people usually use websockets; I’m not sure where I heard of this before though but after quick googling it looks like websockets are the next step after creating a server. I suppose I could use libraries like StarScream? And I suppose <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/861-websockets-on-ios-with-starscream">https://www.raywenderlich.com/861-websockets-on-ios-with-starscream</a> actually lays out building a simple chat app</p>

          <p>For this post I want to try out the Socratic method I happened upon in this new book I’m reading, <em>The Consolations of Philosophy</em> by Alain de Botton.</p>

<p>Apparently I’ll need to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Locate a statement confidently described as common sense. So for me that statement is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>“Change is hard to get used to.”</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imagine the statement is false by searching for situations or context the statement would not be true.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Could one ever remove comparison points and set the ‘changed state’ as the ‘base state’?</em></li>
      <li><em>Could a person ever not need to change and ‘naturally’ assimilate to situations through ignorance of any change that may or may not have happened?</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the statement contains an exception, the statement is not precise or is false.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>It is possible to mimic a blank slate and open mindset and not require change.</em></li>
      <li><em>It is possible to not need to get used to change.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change the original statement to take the exception into account.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Change is perception that can involve either adjustment, or the ability to take every situation as new such that all change is new. In other words, change is the same as change having not occurred.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>“The product of thought is superior to the product of intuition.”</p>

<p>tl;dr. Think about counter-arguments to blanket statements.</p>

<p>I thought of this topic primarily because I’ve gone through, and at times struggled, with many changes the past few months. I moved apartments, changed teams, gone through re-orgs, changed managers, acted as a manager, changed projects, and changed goals.</p>

<p>With every change that occurred I felt more pressure to prove to myself that I was just as good, if not better, than before. In a way I ironically wanted to prove to myself that nothing had changed and that I could continue to progress just as quickly as before. While I view every change as a new opportunity, it’s easy for any change to add further weight or stress onto any state. My conclusion in facing numerous changes is to take the time to refocus by re-evaluating my goals.</p>

<p>I’ve said before, but I want to optimize learning and trying as many things as I can. I don’t believe I’ve utilized where I live and where I work to the fullest extent. I want to figure out why I feel this way, and how I can better take advantage of my environment. In order to do so however I need to figure out in more detail what it is that I want to learn and do. Ultimately the main goal with this thought process is to build resilience and create an internal north star that focuses on honing my skills no matter how many external variables change.</p>

<p>So far the pattern of the work I do is defined by what is needed around me. The solutions that I then implement come intuitively based off of what I think defines a good product experience. I’ve so far acted on intuition (and have honed habits, or a ‘comfortable’ train of thought with regards to how to build a great product) by having external variables define what I do. That’s not to say that I haven’t learned or grown this past year, nor that reacting to external factors isn’t a good way to grow. On the contrary I’ve grown more than I could’ve ever hoped for prior to having accepted my job offer. The next step I want to take though is how to continue challenging myself in the face of having found a niche I’m comfortable with.</p>

<p>To practice the Socratic method - the other side could suggest that I can continue to develop my strength and focus in on what defines a great product experience (aka dive deep on what I’ve been doing). I’d then develop my original statement of “<em>I can challenge myself to find new areas of growth by seeking out different experiences</em>” to “<em>Develop a well-rounded thought process to understand and recommend degrees of feasibility and necessity which could indirectly increase opportunities of finding other areas of strength</em>”. Dang that’s a weak counterexample. The premise of the ‘refined’ statement is that I want to broaden and expand my skillset. For example, I can say that a great product experience can be limited by infrastructure right now; but I don’t know how or why and what solutions can solve this.</p>

<p>#######</p>

<p>This morning I took time to really learn. I went down the rabbit hole of reading article after articles of mikeash, nshipster, cocoawithlove, internal wikis on operating systems and performance optimizations. My new project requires me to understand the nuances of how the entire system works. While I know part of me wanted to work on iOS because I would have the opportunity to dive as deep as I wanted and better understand operating systems, not just the UI - diving deeper down the stack can be really intimidating.</p>

<p>Where do I start? Asking questions.</p>

<p>So what was the hard part? Running out of questions to ask because I wanted to ask ‘smart’ questions that are specific and seemed well-thought out.</p>

<p>A really wise coworker let me know for this type of work it’s okay to start out by asking broader question - framing questions to the expert on hand with ‘Here’s what I think: a, b, c, d. What do you think about my thought process?’ and basing conversations and growth off of the experiences of senior engineers.</p>

<p>That’s awesome. Already learning a new thought process.</p>

<p>#######</p>

<p>I want to explore ARKit and/or TensorFlow and attend a conference or MeetUp around picking up these technologies. I had a lot of fun helping create the Pokemon AR game two years back and want to do something similar again with a bit more functionality. I don’t know what role AR has to play other than in games and education just yet but after having watched these videos.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5eWys9B-no" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OsnfQsBpKIs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I’m pretty stoked to try them out myself. Hopefully the perf work I’m starting to do at work can help contribute to the large battery drains that I observed previously when working with Unity and game dev. On another note I really wish I’d gone to the try!Swift conference, but that’s okay. Another year another time.</p>

          <p>“A group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common.”</p>

<p>This definition of ‘community’ suggests that people who disagree in opinions can still be in the same community. A single similar trait can grow a friendship. I find that concept fascinating.</p>

<p>When greeting or passing others in the hallway it’s easy to ignore or ‘forget’ to say hi and make small talk. All speculation without any numbers to back this, but there seem to be more people who are entrenched in their own online bubbles where the feed algorithm and social apps show people content they know they’ll enjoy and like.</p>

<p>Can a person online’s personality ever become the personality the show in person? I speak differently online than I do in person, but that’s primarily because I have the space to think about how to word the thoughts I have, or conversely, the ability to reply instantaneously without a second thought. I wonder if it’s possible to show our true selves online?</p>

<p>Or are we at the point where our online selves are our true selves?</p>

<p>Just food for thought.</p>
