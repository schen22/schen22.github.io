          <p>“I believe that maturity is not an outgrowing, but a growing up: that an adult is not a dead child, but a child who survived” - Ursula K Le Guin</p>

<p>“The opposite of spare time is, I guess, occupied time. In my case I still don’t know what spare time is because all my time is occupied. It always has been and it is now. It’s occupied by living.” - Ursula K Le Guin</p>

<p>I keep reading voraciously to find the answer. What’s my question though? I have this unsettling unease where I keep wanting to settle down. Like an unreachable itch to satisfy the unease won’t rest. Where am I going, to what end will I reach my destination?</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s just about going out there and doing it.</p>

<p>How does data flow between server and client?
I think people usually use websockets; I’m not sure where I heard of this before though but after quick googling it looks like websockets are the next step after creating a server. I suppose I could use libraries like StarScream? And I suppose <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/861-websockets-on-ios-with-starscream">https://www.raywenderlich.com/861-websockets-on-ios-with-starscream</a> actually lays out building a simple chat app</p>

          <p>For this post I want to try out the Socratic method I happened upon in this new book I’m reading, <em>The Consolations of Philosophy</em> by Alain de Botton.</p>

<p>Apparently I’ll need to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Locate a statement confidently described as common sense. So for me that statement is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>“Change is hard to get used to.”</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imagine the statement is false by searching for situations or context the statement would not be true.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Could one ever remove comparison points and set the ‘changed state’ as the ‘base state’?</em></li>
      <li><em>Could a person ever not need to change and ‘naturally’ assimilate to situations through ignorance of any change that may or may not have happened?</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the statement contains an exception, the statement is not precise or is false.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>It is possible to mimic a blank slate and open mindset and not require change.</em></li>
      <li><em>It is possible to not need to get used to change.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change the original statement to take the exception into account.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Change is perception that can involve either adjustment, or the ability to take every situation as new such that all change is new. In other words, change is the same as change having not occurred.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>“The product of thought is superior to the product of intuition.”</p>

<p>tl;dr. Think about counter-arguments to blanket statements.</p>

<p>I thought of this topic primarily because I’ve gone through, and at times struggled, with many changes the past few months. I moved apartments, changed teams, gone through re-orgs, changed managers, acted as a manager, changed projects, and changed goals.</p>

<p>With every change that occurred I felt more pressure to prove to myself that I was just as good, if not better, than before. In a way I ironically wanted to prove to myself that nothing had changed and that I could continue to progress just as quickly as before. While I view every change as a new opportunity, it’s easy for any change to add further weight or stress onto any state. My conclusion in facing numerous changes is to take the time to refocus by re-evaluating my goals.</p>

<p>I’ve said before, but I want to optimize learning and trying as many things as I can. I don’t believe I’ve utilized where I live and where I work to the fullest extent. I want to figure out why I feel this way, and how I can better take advantage of my environment. In order to do so however I need to figure out in more detail what it is that I want to learn and do. Ultimately the main goal with this thought process is to build resilience and create an internal north star that focuses on honing my skills no matter how many external variables change.</p>

<p>So far the pattern of the work I do is defined by what is needed around me. The solutions that I then implement come intuitively based off of what I think defines a good product experience. I’ve so far acted on intuition (and have honed habits, or a ‘comfortable’ train of thought with regards to how to build a great product) by having external variables define what I do. That’s not to say that I haven’t learned or grown this past year, nor that reacting to external factors isn’t a good way to grow. On the contrary I’ve grown more than I could’ve ever hoped for prior to having accepted my job offer. The next step I want to take though is how to continue challenging myself in the face of having found a niche I’m comfortable with.</p>

<p>To practice the Socratic method - the other side could suggest that I can continue to develop my strength and focus in on what defines a great product experience (aka dive deep on what I’ve been doing). I’d then develop my original statement of “<em>I can challenge myself to find new areas of growth by seeking out different experiences</em>” to “<em>Develop a well-rounded thought process to understand and recommend degrees of feasibility and necessity which could indirectly increase opportunities of finding other areas of strength</em>”. Dang that’s a weak counterexample. The premise of the ‘refined’ statement is that I want to broaden and expand my skillset. For example, I can say that a great product experience can be limited by infrastructure right now; but I don’t know how or why and what solutions can solve this.</p>

<p>#######</p>

<p>This morning I took time to really learn. I went down the rabbit hole of reading article after articles of mikeash, nshipster, cocoawithlove, internal wikis on operating systems and performance optimizations. My new project requires me to understand the nuances of how the entire system works. While I know part of me wanted to work on iOS because I would have the opportunity to dive as deep as I wanted and better understand operating systems, not just the UI - diving deeper down the stack can be really intimidating.</p>

<p>Where do I start? Asking questions.</p>

<p>So what was the hard part? Running out of questions to ask because I wanted to ask ‘smart’ questions that are specific and seemed well-thought out.</p>

<p>A really wise coworker let me know for this type of work it’s okay to start out by asking broader question - framing questions to the expert on hand with ‘Here’s what I think: a, b, c, d. What do you think about my thought process?’ and basing conversations and growth off of the experiences of senior engineers.</p>

<p>That’s awesome. Already learning a new thought process.</p>

<p>#######</p>

<p>I want to explore ARKit and/or TensorFlow and attend a conference or MeetUp around picking up these technologies. I had a lot of fun helping create the Pokemon AR game two years back and want to do something similar again with a bit more functionality. I don’t know what role AR has to play other than in games and education just yet but after having watched these videos.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5eWys9B-no" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OsnfQsBpKIs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I’m pretty stoked to try them out myself. Hopefully the perf work I’m starting to do at work can help contribute to the large battery drains that I observed previously when working with Unity and game dev. On another note I really wish I’d gone to the try!Swift conference, but that’s okay. Another year another time.</p>

          <p>“A group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common.”</p>

<p>This definition of ‘community’ suggests that people who disagree in opinions can still be in the same community. A single similar trait can grow a friendship. I find that concept fascinating.</p>

<p>When greeting or passing others in the hallway it’s easy to ignore or ‘forget’ to say hi and make small talk. All speculation without any numbers to back this, but there seem to be more people who are entrenched in their own online bubbles where the feed algorithm and social apps show people content they know they’ll enjoy and like.</p>

<p>Can a person online’s personality ever become the personality the show in person? I speak differently online than I do in person, but that’s primarily because I have the space to think about how to word the thoughts I have, or conversely, the ability to reply instantaneously without a second thought. I wonder if it’s possible to show our true selves online?</p>

<p>Or are we at the point where our online selves are our true selves?</p>

<p>Just food for thought.</p>

      </header>
      <div class="post_excerpt">
        <p>
          
          <p>I wanted to share nuggets of wisdom from various people I’ve been meeting up within the industry. The primary questions I’ve been asking are what drives their confidence, what their journey entails, and what the most pivotal moment of their career has been so far. It was fascinating to learn and observe how everyone has their own style, work ethic and drive; and yet they all attained a relative degree of success and satisfaction that they wanted.</p>

<p><strong>Nugget #1: Optimize for happiness.</strong></p>

<p>For me, this translates to building something useful for others: share warm and fuzzies, allow others to feel that they belong, and give people a platform to be heard by recognizing every person has a voice they can use. Facebook has the power to accomplish this, but more on this later.</p>

<p><strong>Nugget #2: Believe in yourself.</strong> Continue doing what needs to be done, and the rest will follow.</p>

<p>My mentor resolves conflicts by being so good others are unable to ignore them. Of course, it helps that my mentor loves to build and solve problems. Truly an inspiration for me to keep learning from. :)</p>

<p><strong>Nugget #2.5: Trust yourself.</strong> You’ll become better at estimating and setting deadlines. Tell your manager what the unknown factors are and add a little more time into how long you think it might actually take.</p>

<p><strong>Nugget #3: Break things to learn!</strong> Break apart small pieces to figure out what makes a solution work. For any challenge you’re facing, someone has probably already built a solution or something that’s similar.</p>

<p><strong>Nugget #4: Keep on moving forward.</strong> As long as you don’t hate what you’re doing and don’t hate your team - keep at it. There’s always a better way to do something, and you should always recognize that. But don’t beat yourself up for not implementing the perfect solution right off the bat. Recognize that there’s always a better way to build what you’re building, but also recognize that you’ve gotten better, you’ve improved, and that you’ve learned.</p>

<p>My mentor encouraged me to look back at old code I’ve written, then realize that I probably wouldn’t have written it that way if I were to do it again. And that’s progress.</p>

<p>After meeting up with multiple people, I also realized it’s not just advice I was looking for. I was looking for some way to find myself and find my own drive, intuition, and confidence. But at some point I just have to tune out the self-doubt I have in order to focus on what’s next. Just keep moving forward and the path will follow.</p>
