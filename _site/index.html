        <p>
          
          <p>Happy Leap Day! Lately I’ve been interested in learning more about inequality, how markets work, and where money comes from. This post dives more into the economics aspects to better understand what I’ve learned.</p>

<p>I’m still in the process to to learn various ideologies from Keynes, Friedman regarding macroeconomics, and explore their counter-arguments. The most fascinating thing I’ve learned thus far is that there exists various types of capitalism. And that there’s a blatant disregard and dislike most Americans hold fo socialism. But why, and what does socialism mean?</p>

<p>If anything my new interest categories I’m currently learning about remind me of my school days. I remember learning ‘-isms’ in a history class I took in high school. And all the economics courses I took in college. It’s quite amazing how things come full-circle. If only I had questions to focus my studies while learning in school, it would have made my learning so much more productive. Never too late though?</p>

<p>Current question(s) focus I have is: why does inequality exist and what role does the market vs government vs corporations play to temper inequality?</p>

<p>In any case, I wanted to take a chance to reflect on what I’ve been learning from various books:</p>

<p>In <em>Free to Choose</em> Friedman argues that governments is a limiting factor. Prices hold key pieces information to allow the market to self-function and provide. i.e. if the government interjects and mandates certain prices and limits for goods sold, there’s a negative consequences that prevent market players how to function and price accordingly. The underlying theme is that all buyers and sellers are pipelines that coexist and influence each other’s behaviors. Seems to make sense.</p>

<p>So let’s apply those principles to current US economics. Joseph Stiglitz’ presents in his book <em>The Great Divide</em>: failure to follow free market principles have driven the inequality divide. Stiglitz argues how bailing out the big banks in 2008 have continued the trend to allow companies to preside and retain monopoly-like power. The argument is that this prevents the market from acting in accordance to basic principles of price-setting. This furthers the problem of inequality as those in the ‘top 1%’ stay at the top though ‘money-voting’ rather than ‘people-voting’. i.e. “socialism for the wealthy” as a result of tax cuts. The main theme was moving people to be selfish to support, create, restore the power of the middle-class for yourself to fulfill the American Dream. Else risk collapsing into Great Depression-like states.</p>

<p>Hrm. This leads me to wonder more about what are the incentives that drive banks, big-tech companies and workers? Obviously money. But here’s a thought experiment that’s been stuck in my head: if the government were to dole out subsidies to sponsor education at affordable rates (or free), and increase access to health care – does that mean the incentive to provide higher quality education and health care from those actors decrease?</p>

<p>My assumptions for this in practice are that health care and education costs will still stay the same though?</p>

<p>Reading and thinking more is making me confused. If I return to a sub-question I wanted to solve: what can I do to increase access to opportunities provided to me? I can help volunteer, teach others, or understand where the differences are to target.</p>

<p>I’ve tried the first two. But I haven’t done the last one at all. So I’ll continue to read, learn and think more I guess. Hopefully my line of thinking will become more coherent as time passes.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

      <div class="post_excerpt">
        <p>
          
          <p>On July 26th, I reached 2 years at Facebook. You may have read a similar form <a href="https://schen22.github.io/reflections/2016/12/16/Reflections-as-a-Software-Engineer.html">of this post</a> already. This is a new version of that post but with more ramblings. Having worked a total of three years in industry I felt it was time for another yearly reflection mark.</p>

<p>I recently came across reflections I wrote in college about my relationship with Computer Science and Software Engineering. I read about how my first internship with IBM my junior summer in college was “A dream come true that made me fall in love with CS.”</p>

<p>Fundamentally that internship was pivotal in allowing me discover how much I love to build. All the self-doubts I had of myself were conquered because of this sole desire to build, to be better, and to make cool and useful things.</p>

<p>Boring drive? I don’t know - that drive to build and improve has led me to where I am today. If you told sophomore year college me how I would be working at Facebook building one of the most used products, I would’ve scoffed in your face, “Yeah, right.”</p>

<p>I used to hold all software engineers and people who majored in Computer Science on pedestals. I had thought: “All the projects I worked on [at IBM] and the people I met were amazing. I want to be just as cool and smart as they were/are.” The one thing that’s changed about me the most over the course of three years is how I view myself, and other engineers.</p>

<p>Some of my coworkers are bad-ass wizards who push me to learn and explore beyond my boundaries. All of my coworkers are great and easy to work with (thankfully). However, it was important for me to recognize <em>most</em> engineers are not god-like people who can just figure things out instantly, code without introducing any bugs, and have a complete understanding of how things work.</p>

<p>Great engineers are people that know how to identify problems, figure out which problem to solve, and apply themselves lazily so that minimal effort drives maximum product value. Realizing this made it easier for me to feel more like I belonged, and less like I was not qualified to be an engineer among the best and the brightest.</p>

<p>To be able to create the best products, I need to be able to collaborate well. This means that any thoughts or opinions I have of others that would reduce the chances of my talking with them would be detrimental to the product vision I have in my head.</p>

<p>Of course there were times that I lost sight of the big picture goal I had for why I was an engineer. Things aren’t always rainbows and sunshine :) Sometimes my passion to build went out like a fire due to things outside of my control: upper management, bureaucracy. Sometimes my passion disappeared if I failed to have a growth mindset. However this passion to build would always be re-kindled upon talking with my co-workers, learning something I never knew before, and observing how users use the products I create.</p>

<p>The development cycle to me is a process of never ending improvement. I have faith that for any product and problem space I choose to work on, the solutions I find and the product I build have the potential to improve and better people’s lives. And that continues to excite me.</p>

<p>Looking forward to even more exciting adventures and the next few years.</p>

          <p>“Tomorrow or the next day or the next month or maybe even next year (my personal record is nine years waiting for the second half of a refactoring), the insight comes. Either you understand why you were wrong, or you understand why you were right. In any case, the next step is clear. You take the step with the confidence you had when you started. Maybe you’re even a little abashed at how stupid you could have been not to have seen it all along. Don’t be. It happens to everyone.” - Kent Beck</p>

<p>I’m currently reading through (or more accurately, attempting to read through) “Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code.” The reasons for why is I can recognize when code is beautiful, but I can’t figure out what makes code beautiful. I can grasp the over-arching concepts of readability, scoping, hiding information other classes or functions shouldn’t need to know, ease of adding to or flexibility of the code’s core foundation.</p>

<p>My questions here are how do people typically read technical books? This book, while great and gives solid and sound advice, is so super dense that I can’t help but feel I’m not getting all of what I should be out of what is being taught and explained.</p>

<p>“I think my career and the way I do things—the one word that kind of sums it up is “exploring.” I love exploring the edges—of ideas, of projects, and the physical earth, whatever it is—people too—and that I find very exciting.
But there’s a flip side in that I’m a starter, not a finisher. I get attracted to new things. The field of compilers was just a marvelous field because the computers continued to present challenges. And the problems being solved continued to be increasingly challenging.” - Fran Allen</p>

<p>Leaving this post as is and unresolved, but actively working to improve this by just coding and reading more code.</p>

          <p>Today was wonderful.</p>

<center><img src="assets/img/kay_performance.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500" /></center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>As soon as Sarah Kay and Phil Kaye started performing, I started crying. I don’t know if growing older means I become more easily overtaken by emotions, or if I appreciate the beauty of language and words more - but I sure appreciate the ability to bask in the talents of others. Ohmygoodness witnessing others’ talents is truly awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>The words performed seemed to express the essence of life, of understanding, friendship, love, heartbreak, pain, conflict; the ups and downs of everyday moments. I want to say Sarah and Phil’s poems were simple but they are so much more. I rushed to buy Sarah’s books.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<center><img src="assets/img/kay_books.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500" /></center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The poem that’s stuck with me the most taught me that a murmuration is a flock of starlings. I can still remember: Sarah Kay lifts her arms to mimic a bird flying. As she speaks, a flock of birds forms the image of a bird across salted waves and a sanded beach. She hasn’t even started her poem yet. She explains how the poem she’s about to perform came into being, “I came across this quote one day, ‘the universe has already written the poem you were going to write,’ and I agonized over it as a poet.”</p>

<p>She then explained how there’s nothing truly new that exists in the world, but that doesn’t mean every poem she writes will necessarily recreate another’s work. It also doesn’t mean she needs to spend more time to create original, fresh work. Instead, poetry is about finding new perspectives to view the same, ‘old’ thing.</p>

<p>As an engineer, as an artist - there are the same trends that fall, rise, fall, only to rise again in a seemingly unpredictable fashion. The constant in the change is knowing that the same trend will come back again.</p>

<p>I think what stuck even more in my head is hearing that someone I’ve been admiring for 7 years now, can struggle and can overcome even after a decade or longer of performing as a professional artist - I don’t know why but it really comforted me. The realization of not needing to pressure myself to create distinct products was also nice.</p>

<center><img src="assets/img/kay_signature.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500" /></center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>If you haven’t listened to Sarah Kay, I can’t recommend her art enough. The following poem comforted me my first semester at Berkeley when I felt homesick, soaked from the autumn downpour, and chilled to the core. Her poem provided me strength to keep moving forward. I guess that’s why I stood in line to grab her signature, too overcome to exchange anything other than my name. I think I even forgot to say thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sarah. Thank you, Phil.</p>

          <p>Ursula K Le Guin quotes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I believe that maturity is not an outgrowing, but a growing up: that an adult is not a dead child, but a child who survived.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The opposite of spare time is, I guess, occupied time. In my case I still don’t know what spare time is because all my time is occupied. It always has been and it is now. It’s occupied by living.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I keep reading voraciously to find the answer. What’s my question though? I have this unsettling unease where I keep wanting to settle down. An unreachable itch that won’t rest until I figure out what it is that I do best. Where am I going? What marks the end? What is my destination?</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s just about going out there and doing it. Whatever ‘it’ refers to.</p>
