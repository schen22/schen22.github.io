    [Disclosure: I left IBM around June 2017, and joined Facebook shortly after. I'm forever thankful for all the opportunities IBM offered me.]

It\'s been about six months since I joined IBM as a software engineer. About the amount of time people say it takes for someone to become fully accustomed to the job and its expectations. To be honest, I feel like I\'ve changed a lot in the past six months in terms of mindset, character, and the actions I take.

I used to be hesitant about asking for help, and doubted every decision I made. Now I realize how much time I waste when I\'m hesitant or doubtful. Instead, I just don\'t think about it. I ask questions when I need clarification or when I\'m confused. I advocate for myself and let people know I want to be more involved. I encourage myself to speak up by applauding myself silently whenever I speak to a group of people. I build confidence in the code I write by having more pairs of eyes read my code and provide feedback. My goal is to learn more, so I just keep going and I go out there to learn more.

My favorite part about my job is having access to the depth and breadth of knowledge at IBM. I\'m able to talk to people in Massachusetts, New York, China, Brazil, from my little standing desk in Austin. For an explanation of what I do at work - I\'m currently helping build and maintain the Swift SDK for Watson services offered on Bluemix. This means I get the opportunity to also consume the SDK and write awesome demo apps to showcase all the services.

The best days are when I reach out to the Watson Developer Cloud and discuss how to implement a model or interface with the goal to easily use and maintain in the future. The first time I asked for help, I was timid and shy, and wasn\'t sure if I would be fast enough to understand what they were saying. I was afraid I would be judged for the stream of questions that I would have, or that the code I was writing was a poor, stupid implementation. But I\'m thankful I reached out because I had the most invigorating, amazing conversation. The setting was uncomfortable enough to stimulate my understanding of how to best design implementations and features for an SDK. I ended that work day with feelings of exhilaration. Like the first time I drove a car by myself.

The harder days that seem like a drag are when I am so buried in my code or work that I forget to talk to people. Those are no bueno, but at the same time, complaining about having to write code is like complaining about being full. It\'s a much appreciated, desired necessity.

Sometimes time passes so quickly, I have to remind myself how much I\'ve accomplished within these six months. I\'m so thankful for the mentors I\'ve found, and for the opportunity I\'ve been given to work at IBM.

Within the past six months, I won awards at IBM\'s New Talent Showcase for \'Best Overall Poster\' and \'Best Exhibit Poster.\' My technical mentor and I made an app showcasing Watson\'s Alchemy API, Conversation, Speech to Text and Text to Speech services. The app went on to be presented at the [World of Watson Conference](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/events/wow/) by our department\'s Distinguished Engineer (for non-IBM\'ers that means he\'s high up there in the org chart). I also had the awesome opportunity to attend [Grace Hopper Conference](http://ghc.anitaborg.org/) to recruit for IBM and attend talks. I organized a few presentations at local charter schools to inspire students to become engineers by presenting an augmented reality Pokemon app a two teammates and I made. And right now, I stepped up to become team lead and scrum master for [Watson Developer Cloud's Swift SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/ios-sdk).

I say all these to reassure myself of what I\'ve done - why I am capable and should be confident in my abilities. I think recognizing accomplishments and practicing humility should go hand in hand. It\'s important for me to speak up for myself and not get drowned out by those with louder voices. And I need to keep reminding myself to do so.

At the end of the day, regardless of how I feel and what I\'ve accomplished - I\'m an engineer at IBM. I\'m not saying what I do defines what it means to be an engineer. \'Engineer\' is just a title I have, and I\'m just doing my best to learn as much as I can. I\'m super excited and thankful for all that I can learn, and have learned here.
