        <title>Gotta Catch 'em All</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I’ve posted and I feel I owe it to myself to explain what I’ve been up to in order to figure out if I can prevent such a long delay from occurring again. A lot has happened in the past few weeks since I last worked on my side project. Unfortunately I was in the middle of writing a post describing learning about dialectrics that work got much busier than expected. A good busy of course! My project proposal at work was approved and I had to juggle defining the vision of the new project, being team lead, teaching scrum master responsibilities to the next scrum master, and developing for both projects I was in charge of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really awesome part though, was that I was also able to continue an Pokemon augmented reality project I’d been working on with two others at work; first as an event for IBM’s “Take Your Kid’s to Work Day,” then at talks for local charter schools, and just this past Tuesday, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://sxswedu.com/expo&quot;&gt;SXSW’s Education Exposition&lt;/a&gt; by participating in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tealsk12.org/&quot;&gt;TEALS’ Science Fair&lt;/a&gt;. TEALS stands for Technology Education and Literacy in Schools and helps promote computer science education courses in high schools. A huge passion of mine is to encourage and drive STEM education for K-12 public schools because I believe access to STEM drives more opportunities. STEM is growing at a rapid pace, and we need our future leaders, engineers, scientists, teachers and young professionals to be on the forefront of that change, earlier on. So what way is better than inspiring students into STEM through Pokemon? Makes it fun for both me and the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pokemil/sxsw_edu_expo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with a designer who provided the 3D models and animation, and another engineer who introduced me to coding augmented reality games with Unity and Vuforia SDK. I added a shader to the 3D models to make sure the objects looked more like cartoons; otherwise the color was slightly off. When I added a shader though, I realized how similar all of the concepts were to the Ray Tracing project I had picked up! Depending on the albedo, and the number of light sources, the color of the 3D object differed. Taking into account that we had only one light source, and that handy toon shaders could be imported into the Unity project, I was happy to find how more realistic the Pokemon looked after the shader was applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a shader was applied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pokemil/pikachu_preshader.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the shader was applied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pokemil/pikachu_postshader.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting everything together with the animation the designer gave us, the image recognition of the vinyl print in order to display the 3D object (Pikachu), here’s one of the Pokemon we were able to show at the SXSW Education Exposition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pokemil/ar_demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the demo was a blast. We had three vinyl prints that represented three different Pokemon: Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Mew. The students loved it, the parents loved it, the educators, after hearing my (and all the other IBM volunteers I was able to convince to come) spheal about how important AR could be within education, loved it. At first parents and educators were curious why we were at the exposition demonstrating a seemingly random AR game. However, augmented reality apps and games, similar to virtual reality, have the power to change how students will learn in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine having similar icons to the vinyl print we created, placed in a textbook. A student points their phone into the textbook at the icon. The chapter is about animal cells and cell parts. Imagine students taking apart a cell, and discovering again what scientists had discovered in a lab, but in a classroom with their friends! Simply awe-inspiring. The concepts would be more intriguing as students would be relating to the experience first-hand, and hopefully as a result of being more intriguing, the idea behind the different parts of a cell would be better remembered. Of course, this is all from my perspective as an engineer and student. The actual implementation would be different, but the vision and goal to aim for is what I believe is unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of how we used the AR demo to encourage students towards STEM education, I asked students who were captivated by the Pokemon, what they want to build, what their favorite games were, what their favorite subjects were, and what they loved to do. I showed them how they could relate their passion for Pokemon, gaming, shopping, drawing, and marine biology to the AR game we made, and what we do at IBM. My main goal for attending and ensuring IBM had a presence at the SXSW Education Exposition, was to help students see that you don’t have to have the pre-conceived notion of an “engineering” or “science” mind to be an engineer or a creator. You don’t have to fit into any of the boxes people commonly portray programmers or computer scientists or innovators into. Instead, I wanted to help people see that everything is connected - and the passion to follow what you love, is the most important. (Aside from practicality and reality). The ability to dream and continue exploring was something I wanted to relate to everyone there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 6-year old kid tried to peek behind the phone to see if Bulbasaur was hiding behind it. As he realized nothing was there, he looked back at the screen and yelped in delight again as he saw Bulbasaur again. He tried to hold out his hand to touch Bulbasaur, to locate where he was on the map; only to find his hand again with Bulbasaur in the background! He repeated the same actions again, and looked up in surprise. Right then and there, his look to me and the sparkle and hint at magic made all the hours I put into improving, debugging and testing the app, printing vinyl prints and coordinating volunteer efforts, worth it. Here’s to creating more magical moments for people to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Abstract Different Materials</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting to the real meat/exciting part of the project. By creating Metal and Lambertian materials, I learned how each material interacts with rays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the point a ray hits a sphere, let’s say &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; is the Normal of the point. A reflected ray’s unit vector &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; will have the direction &lt;em&gt;(v + 2B)&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; is the dot product of the vector &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; and the hit point’s normal &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;. The results in the projection of the normal vector onto the ray, as seen with the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Reflect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Vec3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Vec3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Vec3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SubtractVector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MultiplyNum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, lambertian materials diffuse rays. Light is reflected at many angles, so we depict this through randomizing how the ray is scattered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddVector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddVector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RandomInUnitSphere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scattered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Ray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SubtractVector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modifying &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.go&lt;/code&gt; to take into various materials of spheres, and adding fuzzier reflections for larger spheres, we’re given the following image:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adding Materials to Objects</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to take out the jagged edges of the sphere as seen in the last post, the edge pixels must be a blend of the foreground and background. This is done by averaging samples of each material in each pixel. For each pixel, there are several samples within that pixel. Then send rays through each sample. The colors of these rays are averaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This difference allows the blending of edge pixels (pixels in between the background and the foreground) as seen in the comparison between the picture from last chapter and the picture after averaging the pixel colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/out5out6_comparison.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I moved onto creating more things within the images, I learned to create objects and materials. The fun ensued. More progress and cooler pictures were formed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following pictures are examples of diffuse objects that take on the color of their surroundings, adjusted for their own intrinsic color. As Peter Shirley explains in his book, “Light that reflects off a diffuse surface has its direction randomized.” At the same time, the darker the surface is, the more likely absorption is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm to create this is as follows (somewhat summarized):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pick a random point &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; on a unit radius sphere tangent to the hitpoint. Send a ray from the hitpoint &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; to the random point &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;. The sphere then has center (p+N), where &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; is the length of the ray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Peter Shirley notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pick a random point in a unit radius sphere &lt;em&gt;centered at the origin&lt;/em&gt; (rather than tangent to the hitpoint) by using a &lt;em&gt;rejection method&lt;/em&gt;. Pick a random point in the unit cube where &lt;em&gt;x, y&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; range from -1 to +1, rejecting all points that do not fall within the sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejection method is a technique used to generate observations from a distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The described method gives us the following image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/out7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we adjust for the image to be ‘gamma corrected’, we see a light gray color in the image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/out8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the above picture hosts a “shadow acne problem.” In other word pimply splotches due to rays reflecting off of not at exactly t = 0, but instead at t being very close to zero. In order to remove the “shadow acne problem” we have to better specify to ignore hits very near zero, resulting in the following picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/out8-without-pimples.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Debugging and Chapter 5</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So it turned out my bug was including the name of the interface within my struct. So for example, I had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HitableList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Hitable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Hitable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ListSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I initialized the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HitableList&lt;/code&gt; object, I would leave the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hitable&lt;/code&gt; property uninitialized with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HitableList(List: list, ListSize: size)&lt;/code&gt;. This would then create the value: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;nil&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;-100.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;that resulted in the nil pointer dereference error I had received. At the same time, I’m not really sure why the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hit&lt;/code&gt; function would have ever accessed these &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; values. In any case, once I removed all the extraneous &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hitable&lt;/code&gt; properties in all the objects I had, I was able to produce this (wrong) image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/out5bug.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I added print statements into my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; function to better understand why the sphere wasn’t being created, I realized my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HitRecord&lt;/code&gt; object kept getting created. Thus I had to modify my functions and function calls to pass by reference to make sure the record of the surface normals on the object would be recorded and tracked, thereby producing the following final image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/out5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Refactoring and jotting notes about go</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hit somewhat of a rut after refactoring. I ran into this error message after implementing a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hitable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hitableList&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sphere&lt;/code&gt; objects for the ray tracer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;go run main.go &amp;gt; assets/out5.png

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the lack of coding the past few days. Though having to return to work this week also impeded progress. In any case, while this error means my program’s unable to access the list I created within my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HitableList&lt;/code&gt; data structure, instead of trying to do a quick fix, I really need to go back to the basics and figure out what I’m doing in my code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words I need to learn what rendering objects means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;referencing-scratchapixel&quot;&gt;Referencing scratchapixel.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Color and brightness is depicted through how light interacts with an object’s materials. Light contains photons that can be absorbed, reflected or transmitted by an object. The percentage of photons absorbed, reflected and transmitted determines how objects appear in a scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White light contains red, blue and green photons. The color red appears when green and blue photons are absorbed. The red photons reflect the object and allows our eyes to see the object. Each point on an object reflects light rays in different direction. Our eyes’ photoreceptors then converts light into neural signals for our brains to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-go&quot;&gt;Learning Go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Struct is a type that contains named field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; introduces a new type, followed by the name of the type (Circle). &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; keyword indicates we’re defining a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; type and a list of fields inside the curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;float64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;float64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Pi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go automatically passes a pointer into this method without the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pointers&quot;&gt;Pointers.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing I learned about Go and C, it’s that pointers are friends. Especially in custom structs. If you take a look at the Objects created in my last &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schen22/golang-ray-tracer/tree/1aed656e8772ae35d032e6638ba254aa84c28719&quot;&gt;push&lt;/a&gt;, you can see how I had to call the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hit&lt;/code&gt; function by reference in order for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HitRecord&lt;/code&gt; struct to modify the values of its properties without creating a new object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sphere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Hit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Ray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t_min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;float64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t_max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;float64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HitRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HitableList&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hitable&lt;/code&gt; interface, I needed to pass in a reference to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HitRecord&lt;/code&gt; rather than create new objects that don’t store or allow the object to act as a record to whether the object is hittable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about it now makes it seem like a noobish mistake, but lesson learned! Pointers are friends :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chapter Three: Rays, a simple camera and background</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the longest time I was stuck on this bug where the gradient was off. I couldn’t figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/out2-bug.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went over my code in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.go&lt;/code&gt; in the way I understood it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Begin the gradient background in the lower left corner: (-2, -1, -1). Define the width and height of the background to 4 and 2 units; respectively. Represent with the vectors: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;4,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;0,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;0,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;2,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each pixel between the coordinates, scale the ray of light with the horizontal and vertical vectors that are scaled incrementally with the magnitudes u, v.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Form the ray with the direction of the added horizontal, vertical scalars.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the color of the ray by finding its unit vector and scale the magnitude by the y-coordinate that’s bounded by [0, 1].&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Form a linear interpolation between blue (0.5, 0.7, 1.0) to white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) and compute the resulting vector from the direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convert the color vector into RGB values and print out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally realized I had a problem of variable shadowing where I was overriding the values of my horizontal and vertical vectors within my for loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fixing the error, I received the expected output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/out2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onwards to Chapter 4 now! Adding a sphere. Maybe I’ll add more to this post later.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chapter One: Output an Image</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Why did I choose to implement the project in Go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to learn it to understand how it helps concurrency. Plus I was influenced by a friend to take this as an opportunity to learn the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I need to review linear algebra.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Homogeneous coordinates can represent points at infinity and finite points. Somehow this matters for computer graphics and 3D computer vision?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vectors for graphics programs are 4D
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;For geometry: 3D + homogeneous coordinate.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;For colors: RGB plus an alpha transparency channel.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pixels are written left to right, top to bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red goes to black from left to right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Green goes from black to green from bottom to top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;fmt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;P3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;%d %d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;float64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;float64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;255.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;255.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;255.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;%d %d %d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/out1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After asking my friend a few questions, I understand a little more about what the code is doing. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ny&lt;/code&gt; represent the dimensions of the image created. So there are 200x100 pixels in the image created. Each pixel has a rgb value, where each color is represented in bytes: [0, 255]. Each pixel’s value is adjusted by a fraction, akin to how light changes an infinitesimal amount to create a rainbow. As the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; value stays the same, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; values change by fractions to create the red-green spectrum we see in the output.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Setting Up Go Environment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing out how I set up my environment so I can remember later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've downloaded the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;go1.7.4darwin-amd64.pkg&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/dl/&quot;&gt;golang&lt;/a&gt;. Upon installing the package, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;usr/local/go/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory was put in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I need to figure out where to set my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; to. According to the documentation, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable “specifies directories containing Go projects and their binaries outside the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; folder for Go”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translation: it specifies where to look for Go code. Does that mean for every Go project, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; will be different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well according to the wiki, we use a single GOPATH:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even though the GOPATH may be a list of directories, it is generally sufficient to use a single GOPATH for all Go code on your machine. Since all packages retrieved with “go get” have a unique URL (and thus a unique path on disk), having more than one GOPATH is almost never necessary when building with the Go tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I'll just create a directory that will contain all my Go code and add the following lines to my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; so that I won’t have to set it every time I open my terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;GOPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Users/sarahchen/Documents/Personal/go&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;GOPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;://bin:&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/bin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;source ~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; to reload the file and apply to your current terminal session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;go env&lt;/code&gt; to check all the environment variables for Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word of advice - that last bit for setting the path environment variable, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:$PATH&lt;/code&gt;, is quite important. I accidentally didn't have it, and I immediately received these terrifying errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;
-bash: tail: &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;command &lt;/span&gt;not found
-bash: cut: &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;command &lt;/span&gt;not found
-bash: sed: &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;command &lt;/span&gt;not found
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ey, all is well! Fixed it by just resetting my PATH environment variables. To test it all, I followed this  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.golang-book.com/guides/machine_setup#osx-finished&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; and celebrated by playing some Tetris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a hello, world program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/hello-world-golang.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success! Setting up environments always takes awhile. But now to actually begin the ray tracing project! WAHOOO. Time to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/doc/code.html&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It's alive!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wahoo! My website's live and functioning. MWAHAHA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to build a website to keep track of, and hold myself accountable to the projects I want to build. I also wanted to test out how to use Jekyll and host pages on Github. For now, I can keep talking to myself on here instead of out loud! Win-win-win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first projects I wanted to tackle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build this website and host it on github&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow &lt;em&gt;Ray Tracing in One Weekend&lt;/em&gt; and implement in Go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should create timelines? But for now, I think I just want to get this website up and running first and then I'll move forward from there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflections as a Software Engineer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It's been about six months since I joined IBM as a software engineer. About the amount of time people say it takes for someone to become fully accustomed to the job and its expectations. To be honest, I feel like I've changed a lot in the past six months in terms of mindset, character, and the actions I take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be hesitant about asking for help, and doubted every decision I made. Now I realize how much time I waste when I'm hesitant or doubtful. Instead, I just don't think about it. I ask questions when I need clarification or when I'm confused. I advocate for myself and let people know I want to be more involved. I encourage myself to speak up by applauding myself silently whenever I speak to a group of people. I build confidence in the code I write by having more pairs of eyes read my code and provide feedback. My goal is to learn more, so I just keep going and I go out there to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part about my job is having access to the depth and breadth of knowledge at IBM. I'm able to talk to people in Massachusetts, New York, China, Brazil, from my little standing desk in Austin. For an explanation of what I do at work - I'm currently helping build and maintain the Swift SDK for Watson services offered on Bluemix. This means I get the opportunity to also consume the SDK and write awesome demo apps to showcase all the services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best days are when I reach out to the Watson Developer Cloud and discuss how to implement a model or interface with the goal to easily use and maintain in the future. The first time I asked for help, I was timid and shy, and wasn't sure if I would be fast enough to understand what they were saying. I was afraid I would be judged for the stream of questions that I would have, or that the code I was writing was a poor, stupid implementation. But I'm thankful I reached out because I had the most invigorating, amazing conversation. The setting was uncomfortable enough to stimulate my understanding of how to best design implementations and features for an SDK. I ended that work day with feelings of exhilaration. Like the first time I drove a car by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harder days that seem like a drag are when I am so buried in my code or work that I forget to talk to people. Those are no bueno, but at the same time, complaining about having to write code is like complaining about being full. It's a much appreciated, desired necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes time passes so quickly, I have to remind myself how much I've accomplished within these six months. I'm so thankful for the mentors I've found, and for the opportunity I've been given to work at IBM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the past six months, I won awards at IBM's New Talent Showcase for 'Best Overall Poster' and 'Best Exhibit Poster.' My technical mentor and I made an app showcasing Watson's Alchemy API, Conversation, Speech to Text and Text to Speech services. The app went on to be presented at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-01.ibm.com/software/events/wow/&quot;&gt;World of Watson Conference&lt;/a&gt; by our department's Distinguished Engineer (for non-IBM'ers that means he's high up there in the org chart). I also had the awesome opportunity to attend &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghc.anitaborg.org/&quot;&gt;Grace Hopper Conference&lt;/a&gt; to recruit for IBM and attend talks. I organized a few presentations at local charter schools to inspire students to become engineers by presenting an augmented reality Pokemon app a two teammates and I made. And right now, I stepped up to become team lead and scrum master for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/ios-sdk&quot;&gt;Watson Developer Cloud’s Swift SDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say all these to reassure myself of what I've done - why I am capable and should be confident in my abilities. I think recognizing accomplishments and practicing humility should go hand in hand. It's important for me to speak up for myself and not get drowned out by those with louder voices. And I need to keep reminding myself to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, regardless of how I feel and what I've accomplished - I'm an engineer at IBM. I'm not saying what I do defines what it means to be an engineer. 'Engineer' is just a title I have, and I'm just doing my best to learn as much as I can. I'm super excited and thankful for all that I can learn, and have learned here.&lt;/p&gt;
