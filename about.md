Hey it's Sarah! I'm a software engineer working at Facebook. My current interests are in mobile development and random stuff like figuring out how to keep my apartment clean. I also enjoy teaching, cooking, running, hiking, and wandering. Funnish fact - I tend to creep on and take pictures of any dogs I run into. Currently I'm in the journey of finding a good bookstore and/or coffee shop to frequent.

Feel free to explore this website for reflections on books I'm reading, learnings, side projects; thoughts I have on life that I think are worth jotting and sharing.

Here's a dog stealing a cookie in an attempt to encourage more smiles smiled today:
