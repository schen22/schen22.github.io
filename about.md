Hey it's Sarah! I'm a software engineer working at Facebook. My current interests are in mobile development and random stuff like figuring out how to keep my apartment clean. I also enjoy teaching, cooking, running, hiking, and wandering. Currently I'm in the continuous journey of finding great bookstores. I define a great bookstore by how many rare finds I can find in their sale section. :3

**Updates:** I may have found a keeper! Books Inc is fairly close to me, and endearingly claims the title of "the oldest bookstore of the West." They provide a substantial book selection for an independent store. Though I suppose that should come as no surprise because more people here support local businesses.

Feel free to explore this website for reflections on books I'm reading, learnings, side projects; thoughts I have on life that I think are worth jotting and sharing.

Currently I'm in more of a fantasy/sci-fi phase hehe.

List of books I've finished and love:
- Educated
- The Goldfinch
- Unsheltered (for the perspectives. It was a bit much all at once, but the perspectives and the way past and present were intertwined is fascinating)
- A Walk in the Woods
- The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat
- Settling for More
- All the Light We Cannot See
- Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman
- Eleanor and Park by Rainbow Rowell
- Orphan Master's Son

I just realized I need to make a commenting section so I can receive book recommendations. The list of books I have so far is a bit bare. I should probably start updating and using GoodReads more too. Hm.. putting all that in the backlog. Feel free to reach out to me if you're so inclined to add to my book list. I'm always happy to talk book and/or shop. :)

Here's a dog stealing a cookie in an attempt to encourage more smiles smiled today:
