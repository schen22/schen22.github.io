Hey it's Sarah! I'm a software engineer working at Facebook. My current interests are in mobile development and random stuff like figuring out how to keep my apartment clean. I also enjoy teaching, cooking, running, hiking, and wandering. Currently I'm in the middle of a journey to find a good bookstore and/or coffee shop to frequent.

**Updates:** I may have found a keeper! Books Inc is fairly close to me, and endearingly claims the title of "the oldest bookstore of the West." They provide a substantial book selection for an independent store. Though I suppose that should come as no surprise because more people here support local businesses.

Feel free to explore this website for reflections on books I'm reading, learnings, side projects; thoughts I have on life that I think are worth jotting and sharing.

Books I'm currently reading and love:
- A Walk in the Woods
- The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat
- Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore
- Settling for More

Books I've checked out but I'm afraid I'll run out of time to read before they're due back at the library:
- All the Light We Cannot See
- The Alchemist

I can just hear the gasp of shock from you - I can't believe it either! I have yet to read the famous classic others adore. You'll have to forgive me though; my excuse is that it's on my list of books to read!

I just realized need to make a commenting section so I can receive book recommendations. Hm.. putting that in the backlog. Feel free to reach out to me if you're so inclined to add to my book list. I'm always happy to talk book. :)
