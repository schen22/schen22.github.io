Hi I'm Sarah Chen, a software engineer at IBM in Austin, TX and recent spring 2016 graduate of UC Berkeley. My current interests are in mobile development and data analysis. Besides tech, I enjoy teaching, cooking, running, hiking, and wandering. Funnish fact - I tend to creep on and take pictures of any dogs I run into.

Here's a dog for you. Cause doggies and food. Why not?
