Hey, thanks for taking a look at my page! This used to be a website where I jotted random thoughts and learning, but it needs to go through major scrubbing/re-vamp so I'm putting most of it under construction until I get another chance to take a look at it again (as of 9/2021).

re: 30 second blurb about me -- as an iOS and backend engineer, I love working with design and other product partners to build/ensure the best experience possible for end users. Outside of work I love to bug my friends and coerce them to go hiking or running with me. Otherwise you can find me at any combination of the following two sets combined if that makes sense: \{ home \| park \| library } U \{ reading books \| reading manga \| watching my latest anime or kdrama binge \| napping \}.

Until next time!
