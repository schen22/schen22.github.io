---

As a product engineer, I thrive at the intersection of user needs and technical implementation. I love working with design and product partners to build the best possible experience for end users.

Currently a Staff Software Engineer, I've had the opportunity to work on products serving hundreds of millions of users - from Facebook Stories to Instagram Insights to financial infrastructure at Novi. My approach focuses on clear problem definition, cross-organizational collaboration, and building with both technical excellence and user empathy.

### Working With Me

I operate with a people-first mentality and work best in environments that value:

- **Positive reinforcement** and collaborative problem-solving
- **Strong teams build strong products** mindset
- **Cross-functional partnerships** with design, product, and research
- **Mentoring and growth** - I've mentored 5+ engineers and love helping others succeed

### Background

With an economics background entering the CS world, I've learned that different perspectives drive innovation. I'm passionate about creating the safe, supportive spaces I wished existed when I was starting out - because anyone who enjoys building products belongs in tech.

Outside of work, you can find me hiking, reading books and manga, watching anime or K-dramas, or working on personal projects like my current sabbatical explorations.
