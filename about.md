Thanks for taking a look at my page! This used to be a website where I jotted random thoughts and learnings, but it needs to go through major scrubbing/re-vamp so I'm putting most of it under construction until I get another chance to take a look at it again (as of 9/2021).

re: 30 second blurb about me -- as an iOS and backend engineer, I love working with design and other product partners to build/ensure the best experience possible for end users. Outside of work I bug my friends and coerce them to go hiking or running with me. Otherwise you can find me at any combination of the following two sets combined: { home \| park \| library } U { reading books \| reading manga \| watching my latest anime or kdrama binge \| napping }.

Until next time!
