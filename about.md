Hey it's Sarah! I'm a software engineer working at Facebook. My current interests are in mobile development and random stuff like figuring out how to keep my apartment clean. I also enjoy teaching, cooking, running, hiking, and wandering. Funnish fact - I tend to creep on and take pictures of any dogs I run into.

Feel free to explore this website for reflections on struggles, learnings, side projects; thoughts I have on life that I think are worth jotting and sharing.  

I used to have a dog stealing a cookie on this page, but I'm feeling more adventurous these days. Naturally:

Nausicaa. Because the movie best reflects my ideal world, and Nausicaa is my inspiration. Thank goodness for the wonderful, amazing Miyazaki.
