Today was wonderful.

As soon as Sarah Kay and Phil Kaye started performing, I started crying. I don't know if growing older means I become more easily overtaken by emotions, or if I appreciate the beauty of language and words more - but I sure appreciate the ability to bask in the talents of others. Ohmygoodness witnessing others' talents is truly awe-inspiring.

The words performed seemed to express the essence of life, of understanding, friendship, love, heartbreak, pain, conflict; the ups and downs of everyday moments. I want to say Sarah and Phil's poems were simple but they are so much more. I rushed to buy Sarah's books.

The poem that's stuck with me the most taught me that a murmuration is a flock of starlings. I can still remember: Sarah Kay lifts her arms to mimic a bird flying. As she speaks, a flock of birds forms the image of a bird across salted waves and a sanded beach. She hasn't even started her poem yet. She explains how the poem she's about to perform came into being, "I came across this quote one day, 'the universe has already written the poem you were going to write,' and I agonized over it as a poet."

She then explained how there's nothing truly new that exists in the world, but that doesn't mean every poem she writes will necessarily recreate another's work. It also doesn't mean she needs to spend more time to create original, fresh work. Instead, poetry is about finding new perspectives to view the same, 'old' thing.

As an engineer, as an artist - there are the same trends that fall, rise, fall, only to rise again in a seemingly unpredictable fashion. The constant in the change is knowing that the same trend will come back again.

I think what stuck even more in my head is hearing that someone I've been admiring for 7 years now, can struggle and can overcome even after a decade or longer of performing as a professional artist - I don't know why but it really comforted me. The realization of not needing to pressure myself to create distinct products was also nice.

If you haven't listened to Sarah Kay, I can't recommend her art enough. The following poem comforted me my first semester at Berkeley when I felt homesick, soaked from the autumn downpour, and chilled to the core. Her poem provided me strength to keep moving forward. I guess that's why I stood in line to grab her signature, too overcome to exchange anything other than my name. I think I even forgot to say thank you.

Thank you, Sarah. Thank you, Phil.
