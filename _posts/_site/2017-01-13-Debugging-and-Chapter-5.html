<p>So it turned out my bug was including the name of the interface within my struct. So for example, I had:</p>

<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">type</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="n">HitableList</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="k">struct</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="x">
	</span><span class="n">Hitable</span><span class="x">
	</span><span class="n">List</span><span class="x">     </span><span class="p">[]</span><span class="n">Hitable</span><span class="x">
	</span><span class="n">ListSize</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="x">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="x">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, when I initialized the <code class="highlighter-rouge">HitableList</code> object, I would leave the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hitable</code> property uninitialized with <code class="highlighter-rouge">HitableList(List: list, ListSize: size)</code>. This would then create the value: <code class="highlighter-rouge">{&lt;nil&gt; [{ {0 0 -1} 0.5} { {0 -100.5 -1} 100}] 2}</code>that resulted in the nil pointer dereference error I had received. At the same time, I’m not really sure why the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hit</code> function would have ever accessed these <code class="highlighter-rouge">nil</code> values. In any case, once I removed all the extraneous <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hitable</code> properties in all the objects I had, I was able to produce this (wrong) image.</p>

<p>As I added print statements into my <code class="highlighter-rouge">color</code> function to better understand why the sphere wasn’t being created, I realized my <code class="highlighter-rouge">HitRecord</code> object kept getting created. Thus I had to modify my functions and function calls to pass by reference to make sure the record of the surface normals on the object would be recorded and tracked, thereby producing the following final image:</p>
