<p>For the longest time I was stuck on this bug where the gradient was off. I couldn’t figure it out.</p>

<p>I went over my code in <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.go</code> in the way I understood it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Begin the gradient background in the lower left corner: (-2, -1, -1). Define the width and height of the background to 4 and 2 units; respectively. Represent with the vectors: <code class="highlighter-rouge">{4, 0, 0}</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">{0, 2, 0}</code>.</li>
  <li>For each pixel between the coordinates, scale the ray of light with the horizontal and vertical vectors that are scaled incrementally with the magnitudes u, v.</li>
  <li>Form the ray with the direction of the added horizontal, vertical scalars.</li>
  <li>Find the color of the ray by finding its unit vector and scale the magnitude by the y-coordinate that’s bounded by [0, 1].</li>
  <li>Form a linear interpolation between blue (0.5, 0.7, 1.0) to white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) and compute the resulting vector from the direction.</li>
  <li>Convert the color vector into RGB values and print out.</li>
</ul>

<p>I finally realized I had a problem of variable shadowing where I was overriding the values of my horizontal and vertical vectors within my for loops.</p>

<p>After fixing the error, I received the expected output:</p>

<p>Onwards to Chapter 4 now! Adding a sphere. Maybe I’ll add more to this post later.</p>
