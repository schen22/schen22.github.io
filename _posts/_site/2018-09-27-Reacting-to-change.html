<p>For this post I want to try out the Socratic method I happened upon in this new book I’m reading, <em>The Consolations of Philosophy</em> by Alain de Botton.</p>

<p>Apparently I’ll need to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Locate a statement confidently described as common sense. So for me that statement is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>“Change is hard to get used to.”</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imagine the statement is false by searching for situations or context the statement would not be true.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Could one ever remove comparison points and set the ‘changed state’ as the ‘base state’?</em></li>
      <li><em>Could a person ever not need to change and ‘naturally’ assimilate to situations through ignorance of any change that may or may not have happened?</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the statement contains an exception, the statement is not precise or is false.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>It is possible to mimic a blank slate and open mindset and not require change.</em></li>
      <li><em>It is possible to not need to get used to change.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change the original statement to take the exception into account.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Change is perception that can involve either adjustment, or the ability to take every situation as new such that all change is new. In other words, change is the same as change having not occurred.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>“The product of thought is superior to the product of intuition.”</p>

<p>tl;dr. Think about counter-arguments to blanket statements.</p>

<p>I thought of this topic primarily because I’ve gone through, and at times struggled, with many changes the past few months. I moved apartments, changed teams, gone through re-orgs, changed managers, acted as a manager, changed projects, and changed goals.</p>

<p>With every change that occurred I felt more pressure to prove to myself that I was just as good, if not better, than before. In a way I ironically wanted to prove to myself that nothing had changed and that I could continue to progress just as quickly as before. While I view every change as a new opportunity, it’s easy for any change to add further weight or stress onto any state. My conclusion in facing numerous changes is to take the time to refocus by re-evaluating my goals.</p>

<p>I’ve said before, but I want to optimize learning and trying as many things as I can. I don’t believe I’ve utilized where I live and where I work to the fullest extent. I want to figure out why I feel this way, and how I can better take advantage of my environment. In order to do so however I need to figure out in more detail what it is that I want to learn and do. Ultimately the main goal with this thought process is to build resilience and create an internal north star that focuses on honing my skills no matter how many external variables change.</p>

<p>So far the pattern of the work I do is defined by what is needed around me. The solutions that I then implement come intuitively based off of what I think defines a good product experience. I’ve so far acted on intuition (and have honed habits, or a ‘comfortable’ train of thought with regards to how to build a great product) by having external variables define what I do. That’s not to say that I haven’t learned or grown this past year, nor that reacting to external factors isn’t a good way to grow. On the contrary I’ve grown more than I could’ve ever hoped for prior to having accepted my job offer. The next step I want to take though is how to continue challenging myself in the face of having found a niche I’m comfortable with.</p>

<p>To practice the Socratic method - the other side could suggest that I can continue to develop my strength and focus in on what defines a great product experience (aka dive deep on what I’ve been doing). I’d then develop my original statement of “<em>I can challenge myself to find new areas of growth by seeking out different experiences</em>” to “<em>Develop a well-rounded thought process to understand and recommend degrees of feasibility and necessity which could indirectly increase opportunities of finding other areas of strength</em>”. Dang that’s a weak counterexample. The premise of the ‘refined’ statement is that I want to broaden and expand my skillset. For example, I can say that a great product experience can be limited by infrastructure right now; but I don’t know how or why and what solutions can solve this.</p>

<p>This morning I took time to really learn. I went down the rabbit hole of reading article after articles of mikeash, nshipster, cocoawithlove, internal wikis on operating systems and performance optimizations. My new project requires me to understand the nuances of how the entire system works. While I know part of me wanted to work on iOS because I would have the opportunity to dive as deep as I wanted and better understand operating systems, not just the UI - diving deeper down the stack can be really intimidating.</p>

<p>Where do I start? Asking questions.</p>

<p>So what was the hard part? Running out of questions to ask because I wanted to ask ‘smart’ questions that are specific and seemed well-thought out.</p>

<p>A really wise coworker let me know for this type of work it’s okay to start out by asking broader question - framing questions to the expert on hand with ‘Here’s what I think: a, b, c, d. What do you think about my thought process?’ and basing conversations and growth off of the experiences of senior engineers.</p>

<p>That’s awesome. Already learning a new thought process.</p>

<p>I want to explore ARKit and/or TensorFlow and attend a conference or MeetUp around picking up these technologies. I had a lot of fun helping create the Pokemon AR game two years back and want to do something similar again with a bit more functionality. I don’t know what role AR has to play other than in games and education just yet but after having watched these videos.</p>

<p>I’m pretty stoked to try them out myself. Hopefully the perf work I’m starting to do at work can help contribute to the large battery drains that I observed previously when working with Unity and game dev. On another note I really wish I’d gone to the try!Swift conference, but that’s okay. Another year another time.</p>
