<p>Yay for app development? Topics I want to look more into to explore and do in my free time, if ever I find myself sitting around at home:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Objective-C Patterns and Best Practices: focus on a topic to research into with various use cases. I can finally take advantage of the books I bought to help with this:
    <ul>
      <li>Memory Management</li>
      <li>App lifecycles</li>
      <li>Facebook technologies (GraphQL, ComponentKit)</li>
      <li>Design patterns: Listener/Announcer, Protocols</li>
      <li>Basic object-oriented programming ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Explore various AR app ideas
    <ul>
      <li>Premise: I recently did a fun AR app that seemed to draw people closer together by having them experience Pokemon at the same time. However it relied on providing a smartphone with a pre-downloaded app. I wonder when we’ll replace our smartphone reliance?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Graphics
    <ul>
      <li>Replicate a scene from Piper (https://fburl.com/b14u4io8)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>App ideas:
    <ul>
      <li>Sample componentKit app to build up components knowledge.</li>
      <li>Fun compliments storage app.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
