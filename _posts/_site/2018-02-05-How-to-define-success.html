<p>I’ve decided I want to define success more concretely, and I happened upon a great read this past weekend that inspired this redefinition. Rather than to be defined or (what I feel at times) restricted to the job I have, the role I play on my team, or the lines of code I write a day, I want to define success on the basis of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number minutes I spend running every day in order to stay healthy and do all the things I want to do in life.</li>
  <li>the number of times I laugh or enjoy the conversations I have by staying present and open-minded to situations around me.</li>
  <li>the number of minutes I spend on the phone with my parents because I care about my family.</li>
  <li>the number of times I speak up among a group of people in order to remember I have a voice.</li>
  <li>the number of lessons learned to satisfy my love of learning and desire to understand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Health, presence, family, attitude and aptitude. Suffice it to say I think these can act as goals to ground me throughout the day to concentrate more on what I want to do, and less on what I do.</p>

<p>While there’s no measure that I can compare myself to just yet, I can create some type of iPython notebook to track (at the very least) physical exercise. I’ve been wanting to get a little more in data analysis. And plus I’m signed up for the half marathon so honestly I should be running more than the 2-3 miles I get. THREE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE! Oh wait, four! Because this way I can guarantee comparisons of myself to me (rather than others).</p>

<p>Now though, I’m wondering how do these definitions of success relate to the goals that I have at work?</p>

<p>I guess to put a different spin on it: in order to learn more, I have to review more code, and ask questions to code more effectively. In a way, the more I do, the more I learn. So by the communicative property, if learning comes first, inherently, the goals or expectations set at work will follow. I think the most important lesson I’ve learned is, “Me first.” Because honestly there’s no one else that will ever do so, nor would I want them to. I have to own my own way and what I do. To do this I have to be comfortable with putting myself first.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean I should become a jackass or some arrogant coworker who only thinks of what I want and ignores all else. I still have my values to keep me in check for that thankfully. Rather, it’s more I want to focus on what I want to accomplish, how to get to where I want to go; rather than to concentrate on how others are doing or give in to the norm. For example the other day at Costco there was this couple that cut in front of me. And rather than speaking up, I just stood there silently and took it. While this may be an extreme example, it’s been aggravating me that I hadn’t spoke up.</p>

<p>But at the same time that’s okay because I can take it as a learning experience. I just need to practice what I should say in these settings because I’m not used to that happening to me. (I mean come on, I’m a cute Asian girl; who can ignore me :P). In any case, next time I’m prepared to say, “Excuse me sir/miss, I was already here in line,” and then give them a chance to explain themselves. If they’re in some sort of emergency then by all means take my spot; but I shouldn’t let people take advantage of me.</p>

<p>Random other goals I’ll update at another time but want to jot down for now:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I want to increase my circle of influence.</li>
  <li>I want to go backpacking or camping in the mountains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cheerios,</p>
