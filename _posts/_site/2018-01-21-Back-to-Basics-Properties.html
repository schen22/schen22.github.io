<p>Some things that seem obvious to others, to me need to be studied more thoroughly. One such topic I want to focus on this week is properties.
But why Objective-C? Mainly because that’s the language we use at Facebook to build our app. And also because I want to better understand why we choose to use Objective-C rather than the ‘sexier’ Swift language.</p>

<p>Properties are thought of as accessors to a variable in a data object.</p>

<p>@synthesize: controls name of instance variable.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@implementation Pokemon
@synthesize type = _myType;
@synthesize name = _myName;
@end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Usually we would just let the compiler automatically write the code for these methods (ie. autosynthesis). For example, the two instance variables above would instead be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_type</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_name</code> with autosynthesis.</p>

<p>To prevent the compiler from synthesizing an accessor method we can use @dynamic. This tells the compiler to not create an instance variable and accessor. Instead the compiler trusts us that the variable will be available at runtime:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@implementation Pokemon
@dynamic type, name;
@end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Property Attributes</em></p>

<p>For example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@property (nonatomic, readwrite, copy) NSString *type;</code></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Atomicity</strong>: By default accessors are locked to ensure atomicity.</li>
  <li><strong>Read/Write</strong>: (readonly, readwrite) where only a getter is available for the former and a getter/setter available for the latter.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory-Management</strong>: affects only the setter
    <ul>
      <li>assign: used for scalar types like CGFloat or NSInteger</li>
      <li>strong: the property defines an owning relationship. I wonder if I can make this analogy. Let’s say we have six Pokemon on hand and we catch a seventh one: Gulpin. Because we are required to hold six Pokemon at all time, we first “retain” Gulpin, “release” Caterpie and set Guplin as our new sixth Pokemon. Similar to a <strong>strong</strong> semantic when a new value is set we first retain it, release the old value, and then set the new value.</li>
      <li>weak: property defines a nonowning relationship. When a new value is set, the new value is not retained and the old value is not released. The main difference between weak and assign is that a weak property’s value will have nilled out if the object it’s defined as is ever destroyed. (Hm I guess the Pokemon analogy doesn’t work at all. Will need to think more otherwise I’ll just be confusing myself. Shall update later).</li>
      <li>unsafe_unretained: same as assign but indicates a nonowning relationship (unretained) that’s not nilled out (unsafe) when the target is destroyed</li>
      <li>copy: owning relationship like strong but rather than retaining value, it copies the value. Usually used for NSString* or mutable objects to preserve encapsulation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Method Names</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>getter=<name>: usually used for Bool properties to define getter name.
</name>        <ul>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@property (nonatomic, getter=didLearn) BOOL learn;</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>setter=<name>: specifies setter name. Not usually used.</name></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Definitions I need to remember</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To be <strong>Statically allocated</strong> means that memory is allocated at compile time.</li>
  <li>A <strong>runtime</strong> is like the baker at a bakery that grabs all the ingredients (data structure, functions, memory-management methods, etc.) to mix together and bake a cake (aka the library that code is linked to to run).</li>
</ul>

<p>Objective-C discovers object type at runtime and can be described as a messaging structure with dynamic binding.</p>

<p>Let’s break that sentence down: Messaging structure uses dynamic binding, meaning the runtime decides which code gets executed. (Whereas languages like python has function calling which decides which code will be executed. I think?).</p>

<p>Need to finish this up later. Time to grocery shop!</p>
