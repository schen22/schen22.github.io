<p>Wahoo! My website's live and functioning. MWAHAHA.</p>

<p>I wanted to build a website to keep track of, and hold myself accountable to the projects I want to build. I also wanted to test out how to use Jekyll and host pages on Github. For now, I can keep talking to myself on here instead of out loud! Win-win-win.</p>

<p>The first projects I wanted to tackle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build this website and host it on github</li>
  <li>Follow <em>Ray Tracing in One Weekend</em> and implement in Go.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe I should create timelines? But for now, I think I just want to get this website up and running first and then I'll move forward from there.</p>
