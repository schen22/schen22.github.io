"A group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common."

This definition of 'community' suggests that people who disagree in opinions can still be in the same community. A single similar trait can grow a friendship. I find that concept fascinating.

When greeting or passing others in the hallway it's easy to ignore or 'forget' to say hi and make small talk. All speculation without any numbers to back this, but there seem to be more people who are entrenched in their own online bubbles where the feed algorithm and social apps show people content they know they'll enjoy and like.

Can a person online's personality ever become the personality the show in person? I speak differently online than I do in person, but that's primarily because I have the space to think about how to word the thoughts I have, or conversely, the ability to reply instantaneously without a second thought. I wonder if it's possible to show our true selves online?

Or are we at the point where our online selves are our true selves?

Just food for thought.
