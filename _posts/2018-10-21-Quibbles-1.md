"I believe that maturity is not an outgrowing, but a growing up: that an adult is not a dead child, but a child who survived" - Ursula K Le Guin

"The opposite of spare time is, I guess, occupied time. In my case I still don't know what spare time is because all my time is occupied. It always has been and it is now. It's occupied by living." - Ursula K Le Guin

I keep reading voraciously to find the answer. What's my question though? I have this unsettling unease where I keep wanting to settle down. Like an unreachable itch to satisfy the unease won't rest. Where am I going, to what end will I reach my destination?

Sometimes it's just about going out there and doing it.
