Ursula K Le Guin quotes

> "I believe that maturity is not an outgrowing, but a growing up: that an adult is not a dead child, but a child who survived."

> "The opposite of spare time is, I guess, occupied time. In my case I still don't know what spare time is because all my time is occupied. It always has been and it is now. It's occupied by living."


I keep reading voraciously to find the answer. What's my question though? I have this unsettling unease where I keep wanting to settle down. An unreachable itch that won't rest until I figure out what it is that I do best. Where am I going? What marks the end? What is my destination?

Sometimes it's just about going out there and doing it. Whatever 'it' refers to.
