Wahoo! My website's live and functioning. MWAHAHA.

I wanted to build a website to keep track of, and hold myself accountable to the projects I want to build. I also wanted to test out how to use Jekyll and host pages on Github. For now, I can keep talking to myself on here instead of out loud! Win-win-win.

The first projects I wanted to tackle:

- Build this website and host it on github
- Follow _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ and implement in Go.

Maybe I should create timelines? But for now, I think I just want to get this website up and running first and then I'll move forward from there.
