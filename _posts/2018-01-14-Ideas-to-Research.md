Fun fact of the day: according to Pew Research Center, 77% of Americans own a smartphone of some kind. It's more than doubled since 2011, where only 35% of Americans owned a smartphone:

Yay for app development? Topics I want to look more into to explore and do in my free time, if ever I find myself sitting around at home:

- Objective-C Patterns and Best Practices: focus on a topic to research into with various use cases. I can finally take advantage of the books I bought to help with this:
  - Memory Management
  - App lifecycles
  - Facebook technologies (GraphQL, ComponentKit)
  - Design patterns: Listener/Announcer, Protocols
  - Basic object-oriented programming ideas
- Explore various AR app ideas
  - Premise: I recently did a fun AR app that seemed to draw people closer together by having them experience Pokemon at the same time. However it relied on providing a smartphone with a pre-downloaded app. I wonder when we'll replace our smartphone reliance?
- Graphics
  - Replicate a scene from Piper (https://fburl.com/b14u4io8)
- App ideas:
  - Sample componentKit app to build up components knowledge.
  - Fun compliments storage app.
