How does data flow between server and client?
I think people usually use websockets; I'm not sure where I heard of this before though but after quick googling it looks like websockets are the next step after creating a server. I suppose I could use libraries like StarScream? And I suppose [https://www.raywenderlich.com/861-websockets-on-ios-with-starscream](https://www.raywenderlich.com/861-websockets-on-ios-with-starscream) actually lays out building a simple chat app

Data structures summary:

super helpful to think about what data structures are and how to approach increasing efficiency and performance through combination of understanding problem type and what to solve
