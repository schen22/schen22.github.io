It's been awhile again but I've been feeling a bit burnt out from work. Thus the need to force myself to reflect more often! So guiding questions if not for today, for every day:

What are three things that made me happy today? (I declare these warm and fuzzies).
- Spending a late Sunday night playing board games spontaneously with friends while making Yu-Gi-Oh jokes to 'trust in the heart of the cards' and d-d-d-d-d-d-d-duel! Spontaneity I feel is harder to come by as years pass, so I lean more into the moment and appreciate how and when it happens.
- Chatting with my grandma, exchanging gossip and being able to remind her that I'll see her soon.
- Seeing the California skyline - backdrop of mountains with a splatter of blue accented white background. California is beautiful and the scenic landscape definitely brought a smile to my face as I was driving down 237 today.

I don't have much on my mind lately which worries me. The one thing I don't want to become is a mindless worker bee that fulfills the expectations and plans passed down from above. Time passes without me realizing, and within a blink of an eye it's already been almost a year since I've moved to the bay area. That frightens me, so how can I take back the reigns and take control of what happens daily? What's my next step?

Step 1. Lean into what I know -- time to start tinkering and put the anime away!

Step 2. Idea pot - quick, jot down all the things that come to mind within a minute:
- Convert all the photos that get shared on Messenger in my family group chat into an album for my family to search through. Add in some photo recognition technology to allow people to easily search by date, place, name/nickname.
- Happiness jar that lets me jot down notes or special moments that make me happy every day for me to look back on. The goal is to help motivate through rough patches and remind myself just how beautiful life is.
- Create one frame of an animation you love. (Though tbh this has been on my mind for awhile, but it seems so difficult I haven't really looked much into it.)
- Running journal - the one I mentioned a while back but never finished LOL.

Step 3. I'm making this up here - so I'm assuming this step should be a plan of action to commit to. Do what I love and ignore all of the wanted accolades, awards, recognition, whatever that puts unnecessary stress on myself. I can only control what I do, and how I feel about myself. 

I'm not too sure what should or will come of this, but I hope I'll create a project some time soon on Github. I like the idea of a happiness jar honestly. Should be a fairly straightforward thing to make - I'll put up some prototypes and get to work.

Lastly, I challenge myself this week to ask to grab lunch with one of my role models at work. One of my coworkers I highly admire recently left. Regrettably I wasn't able to say my farewells and thank you's in person because I chickened out. I honestly can't remember the last time I've been so timid at work to the point where I regret not doing something so badly. I don't want that to happen again - thus this challenge. Like spontaneity, I need to lean in to my fear. And with that, the quote of the day is:
> "The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure, the process is its own reward." - Amelia Earhart
