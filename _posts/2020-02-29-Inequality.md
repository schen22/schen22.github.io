Happy Leap Day! Lately I've been interested in learning more about inequality, how markets work, and where money comes from. This post dives more into the economics aspects to better understand what I've learned.

I'm still in the process to to learn various ideologies from Keynes, Friedman regarding macroeconomics, and explore their counter-arguments. The most fascinating thing I've learned thus far is that there exists various types of capitalism. And that there's a blatant disregard and dislike most Americans hold for socialism. But why, and what does socialism mean?

If anything my new interest categories I'm currently learning about remind me of my school days. I remember learning '-isms' in a history class I took in high school. And all the economics courses I took in college. It's quite amazing how things come full-circle. If only I had questions to focus my studies while learning in school, it would have made my learning so much more productive. Never too late though?

Current question(s) focus I have is: why does inequality exist and what role does the market vs government vs corporations play to temper inequality?

In any case, I wanted to take a chance to reflect on what I've been learning from various books:

In _Free to Choose_ Friedman argues that governments is a limiting factor. Prices hold key pieces information to allow the market to self-function and provide. i.e. if the government interjects and mandates certain prices and limits for goods sold, there are negative consequences that prevent market players to function and price accordingly. The underlying theme is that all buyers and sellers are pipelines that coexist and influence each other's behaviors. Seems to make sense.

So let's apply those principles to current US economics. Joseph Stiglitz' presents in his book _The Great Divide_: failure to follow free market principles have driven the inequality divide. Stiglitz argues how bailing out the big banks in 2008 have continued the trend to allow companies to preside and retain monopoly-like power. The argument is that this prevents the market from acting in accordance to basic principles of price-setting. This furthers the problem of inequality as those in the 'top 1%' stay at the top though 'money-voting' rather than 'people-voting'. i.e. "socialism for the wealthy" as a result of tax cuts. The main theme was moving people to be selfish to support, create, restore the power of the middle-class for yourself to fulfill the American Dream. Else risk collapsing into Great Depression-like states.

Hrm. This leads me to wonder more about what are the incentives that drive banks, big-tech companies and workers? Obviously money. But here's a thought experiment that's been stuck in my head: if the government were to dole out subsidies to sponsor education at affordable rates (or free), and increase access to health care -- does that mean the incentive to provide higher quality education and health care from those actors decrease?

My assumptions for this in practice are that health care and education costs will still stay the same? So in the long-run this seems to be unaffordable, but I like the idea. So I'm in a rut.

Reading and thinking more is making me confused. If I return to a sub-question I wanted to solve: what can I do to increase access to opportunities provided to me? I can help volunteer, teach others, or understand where the differences are to target.

I've tried the first two. But I haven't done the last one at all. So I'll continue to read, learn and think more I guess. Hopefully my line of thinking will become more coherent as time passes. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
