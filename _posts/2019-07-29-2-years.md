[03/01/2020 update: Some posts I write in the past make me cringe in the present. This is one of them. Honestly most reflections make me cringe in the present, but keeping it here for the sake of continuity.]

On July 26th, I reached 2 years at Facebook. You may have read a similar form [of this post](https://schen22.github.io/reflections/2016/12/16/Reflections-as-a-Software-Engineer.html) already. This is a new version of that post but with more ramblings. Having worked a total of three years in industry I felt it was time for another yearly reflection mark.

I recently came across reflections I wrote in college about my relationship with Computer Science and Software Engineering. I read about how my first internship with IBM my junior summer in college was "A dream come true that made me fall in love with CS."

Fundamentally that internship was pivotal in allowing me discover how much I love to build. All the self-doubts I had of myself were conquered because of this sole desire to build, to be better, and to make cool and useful things.

Boring drive? I don't know - that drive to build and improve has led me to where I am today. If you told sophomore year college me how I would be working at Facebook building one of the most used products, I would've scoffed in your face, "Yeah, right."

I used to hold all software engineers and people who majored in Computer Science on pedestals. I had thought: "All the projects I worked on [at IBM] and the people I met were amazing. I want to be just as cool and smart as they were/are." The one thing that's changed about me the most over the course of three years is how I view myself, and other engineers.

Some of my coworkers are bad-ass wizards who push me to learn and explore beyond my boundaries. All of my coworkers are great and easy to work with (thankfully). However, it was important for me to recognize *most* engineers are not god-like people who can just figure things out instantly, code without introducing any bugs, and have a complete understanding of how things work.

Great engineers are people that know how to identify problems, figure out which problem to solve, and apply themselves lazily so that minimal effort drives maximum product value. Realizing this made it easier for me to feel more like I belonged, and less like I was not qualified to be an engineer among the best and the brightest.

To be able to create the best products, I need to be able to collaborate well. This means that any thoughts or opinions I have of others that would reduce the chances of my talking with them would be detrimental to the product vision I have in my head.

Of course there were times that I lost sight of the big picture goal I had for why I was an engineer. Things aren't always rainbows and sunshine :) Sometimes my passion to build went out like a fire due to things outside of my control: upper management, bureaucracy. Sometimes my passion disappeared if I failed to have a growth mindset. However this passion to build would always be re-kindled upon talking with my co-workers, learning something I never knew before, and observing how users use the products I create.

The development cycle to me is a process of never ending improvement. I have faith that for any product and problem space I choose to work on, the solutions I find and the product I build have the potential to improve and better people's lives. And that continues to excite me.

Looking forward to even more exciting adventures and the next few years.

Warm and fuzzies. My team is truly the best.
