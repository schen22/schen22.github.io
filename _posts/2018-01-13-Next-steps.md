Ever since I moved back to California, I've been itching to find something fulfilling to do in my free time. I want the knowledge I have and am learning, to be useful for others and myself. I want to figure out how to best help others with what I know.

It's always this question of how to best use what I know to help others that sits in my mind. The balance between wanting to give back, and needing to take the time for myself to develop the more knowledge and skills to contribute. I aim to always be a life-long learner and teacher, but I often find myself asking - in what?

I need to set aside time to reflect more often with the prospect to one day answer this question by compiling what I have learned together; it is too easy to fall into the habit of taking what I have for granted. I need to remember how grateful I am for being able to afford to live in the Bay area, how grateful I am to be working for one of the top companies in my field, with one of the best teams, and on one of the most exciting projects. I am grateful for being able to learn more and improve myself, every day. I am grateful.

And yet I constantly find myself complaining about the traffic, the lack of affordable housing, the tech bubble that seems suffocating at times. But really - every moment I have no matter where I am is an opportunity to learn from others, and to become more inspired by others and their dreams. Being in the center of the tech industry, information overload occurs all the time with the vast amount of people and talent. But I should recognize that as an opportunity to take advantage of rather than complain and hide behind my insecurities of not knowing enough. I need to remember to keep moving forward and to continue to learn more from those around me.

It's easy to become lost in the flow of time; to be controlled by deadlines, team meetings, bugs filed, and pinging notifications. But the need to sit back and think about all I've done, all that's there for me to learn, is what I now recognize is a higher priority. Here's to taking control of time; what I consider the most valuable and limited resource.

What's next? A journal to keep track of lessons learned; what I'm reading, and how to apply it to day to day life. What I've learned from the book I'm currently reading is to set deadlines for myself to keep myself honest. Dan Ariely describes in _Predictably Irrational_ how I should expect my future self to procrastinate. Thus to combat my future self my present self needs to provide a strict deadline to keep up with.

Here's to beginning to update my website once a week every Sunday morning. Hats off to another chapter.

Cheerios,
