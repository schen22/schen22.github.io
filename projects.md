### Dumb apps

Clearly AI has been a game changer in the amount of personal projects (as well as quality) that I ship:

- [Jun 2025] Feelings Wheel Journal [name pending] - Web-based emotional awareness tool for identifying and processing feelings through interactive journaling. aka my attempt to curb the constant anxiety I have to focus more on the present, think less about the ideal dog I want, and look more at what I have currently. Created to also just play around with claude code [source](https://github.com/schen22/wins-tracker). So the claude.md file I think is the more interesting piece in this repo personally. Project currently half-baked!
- [Jun 2025] Yumi tracker - to track all events and attempt to identify a routine for my puppy. Hosted website on Netlify, db is simple json blobs stored on private github repo; written pretty much by OpenAI. I think it's still pretty sweet though I stopped tracking data cause every time Yumi had an accident I would get stressed she's not at 100% lol. check it out [here][https://broccoli.mom/] [source](https://github.com/schen22/artoo-tracker-data)
- [Jan 2025] Antighosting - an inside joke with friends, really tailored only for myself to use in order to make sure I check in with my friends in a higher-value way than just random texts, and provide prompts for me to stay in touch with. It was funnier in the moment. I just call my friends now lol. Also just me playing around with ChatGPT for the first time to code with. Prompts are generated by OpenAI as well. [source](https://github.com/schen22/antighosting)
- [2023] Bulbasaur pedometer - to encourage people to run, tailored to a guy I used to date, but also was just for fun to animate a Bulbasaur to match when people begin to walk. fun feature is that the pedometer number resets on any software update on android lolol. I'm fairly certain the iOS version doesn't come with this feature. [link](https://github.com/schen22/pokestrides)
- [2019] Wholesome Memes generator - most likely doesn't work anymore given Reddit shut down its api, but this basically just served random content from r/wholesomeMemes. Primarily was my foray to learning flutter and encourage warm and fuzzies for myself. [link](https://github.com/schen22/boredForReddit)
