### Fun Side Projects

Clearly AI has been a game changer in the amount of personal projects (and quality) that I ship:

- **(Jun 2025) Feelings Wheel Journal** `Web: React/Node` - Web-based emotional awareness tool for identifying and processing feelings through interactive journaling. My attempt to curb my anxiety, and focus more on the present (inspired by my pup). Created while playing around with Claude Code. The `claude.md` file is probably the most interesting part of this repo. Currently half-baked! [source](https://github.com/schen22/wins-tracker)

- **(Jun 2025) [yumi tracker](https://broccoli.mom/)** `Web: React/Netlify` - Track all puppy events to identify bathroom routine for my puppy. Website hosted on Netlify, database is simple JSON blobs stored on private GitHub repo; written mostly by OpenAI. Pretty sweet, though I stopped tracking data because every time Yumi had an accident I'd stress that she wasn't at 100% lol. [source](https://github.com/schen22/artoo-tracker-data)

- **(Jan 2025) Antighosting** `Mobile: iOS` - An inside joke with friends, tailored for me to check in with friends in higher-value ways than random texts. Provides prompts to help me stay in touch. Was funnier in the moment - I just call my friends now lol. My first time playing with ChatGPT for coding. [source](https://github.com/schen22/antighosting)

- **(2023) Bulbasaur Pedometer** `Mobile: iOS/Android via Flutter` - Encourage people to run by animating a Bulbasaur that moves when you move to track step count. Fun feature: the pedometer resets on any Android software update. Pretty sure iOS doesn't have this "feature." [source](https://github.com/schen22/pokestrides)

- **(2019) Wholesome Memes Generator** `Mobile: iOS/Android via Flutter` - Probably doesn't work anymore since Reddit shut down its API, but this served random content from r/wholesomeMemes. My adventure learning Flutter to encourage warm and fuzzy feelings. [source](https://github.com/schen22/boredForReddit)

- **(2017) Pokemon AR Experience** `AR: Unity/C#` - Educational augmented reality app showcased at SXSW Education Expo to inspire STEM learning through interactive Pokemon experiences. [Read the full story â†’](/reflections/projects/2017/03/11/Gotta-Catch-Em-All.html)
